5022209206	2020-08-08T01:14:35	almp16	istheservicedown	I am fed up w Altice. Service is AWFUL. always an issue. This is ridiculous. Get ur tech together Altice bc this...n what u charge....is not ok. If we paid $10 a month for this ‚Äúservice‚Äù I wld still feel u were robbing us. I just don‚Äôt feel what we pay is even remotely worth the service we get. Fios is more $ oh but I never had ANY issues w them. Not one. Altice?? Daily. N that‚Äôs not an exaggeration. Ugh It barely rained here, for a short amount of time and when the first raindrops fell boom, cable was out. Again. Cable, WiFi, all of it as usual. It is one problem after another problem after another on and on and on with Altice. I have absolutely had it. Btwn having to reset each individual box in every room every single day,<b></b> the constant message ‚Äúerror......‚Äù ugh awful. N I have never gotten to speak to a person who knows a damn thing. I had Fios for almost 8-9years and never had one issue. Not one. Ever. This is daily w Altice. It‚Äôs a joke. Cannot even explain how frustrated we are.
5022212795	2020-08-08T01:18:50	almp16	istheservicedown	Verizon is SOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I had it for almost 9 years and when I tell u I never ever had one issue. NOT ONE!! Plus Fios‚Äô picture is a thousand times better. Everything was. Switch tonight n u will never have another issue again. 9 years w Fios, not one problem. Less than a year w Altice and DAILY I have a friggin issue. It‚Äôs bs. I am right there w u. Altice is a joke and truly shld not even be allowed to exist. It‚Äôs constant.

5022230183	2020-08-08T01:39:08	None	istheservicedown	Very frustrated using your customer options to report my service outage.  First your telephone answering system takes you through a prerecorded message say ‚Äúan outage has been reported in your area‚Äù then says there are too many other calls ahead of you and hangs up.  The online systems are confusing and even when you get to a screen that prompts for the type of outage it only lets you pick one (e.g., Internet), then thanks for reporting, without requesting any further information - such as important information like the service address - nor if more than one service is affected (all three of our services are out - unsurprisingly).  We were without power for more than 3 days, and the level of frustration (with UI, the utility provider) is high enough already without having to deal with this horrible customer service.  I still don‚Äôt know if Cablevision knows I have a problem, let alone an idea when my service will be restored.  I‚Äôm not sure why I bother commenting here, other than having an opportunity to vent.

5022239768	2020-08-08T01:50:01	None	istheservicedown	What's going on with the cable(TV)? NOTHING that was suggested to "reset" the cable box worked! On the website all we can do indicate which service (s) has a problem. There's no indication of whether or not there 'is' a problem & or what will be done to fix the problem. Customers are just left hanging waiting wondering IF anything is being done, will be done or anything! Not very good customer service üò†

5022256874	2020-08-08T02:10:23	None	istheservicedown	Hey max, the other day I posted about my package from the 27th. It got a departure scan after you commented back. then updated 14 hours later at the same facility with a new departure scan of 36 hours ago. The facility is only 45 minutes away from the local PO. But my local PO says they don‚Äôt have it so I‚Äôm wondering where it could have departed to? Or is it still in Kansas City? I‚Äôm just at a loss.  Tracking number: 9400111899563210576386

Believe it or not, Thurs again around 6:30pm all optimum services went out again - never lost electric! Like everyone else there is no way to contact optimum/altice as they do not ans phones, nor do they provide any info as to a time frame when service would be restored. They need to be held accountable for the lack of even minimum CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Contact your local senators and representatives - if altice can't step up then they should lose their contracts/ franchise or whatever they call the exclusive rights for service that they are not providing while continually raising fees!

Altice has completely turned customer service into an afterthought....why??....because there is very little competition to deal with.  Think about it.....you have Altice/Optimum...and then there is FIOS.  THAT'S IT!!....Altice figures they have us between a rock and a hard place....and they do.  So customer service just means we'll get to you when we feel like it....just keep sending in those checks.

Rebooted, removed all background info and reset network and it still happens. We live in Naples, Fl. I just learned from my daughter who heard from a friend who lives in Naples that we have a tower down but no alert from Verizon sent to let us know. Also since our senior unlimited plan was started I think Verizon throttles us at certain times because we have trouble in the evening with our phone.  Also, I made an appointment for these issues since I got an E-mail about getting support so I went and was let in the store and told they no longer have tech support. How crazy is that?  When  I made the appointment it had an area to describe what was going on and I explained the issues. No one contacted me ahead to say we do not do tech support anymore. If you call Verizon, plan to read War and Peace because of the long wait you will have.  Very bad customer service.

It‚Äôs been miserable data and voice service for the last month which is when I had to switch from Verizon due to work. Verizon at this spot was excellent, likely due to a tower at Hopkins Dairy. Come on AT&T. This is loathsome service.
5023350080	2020-08-09T02:00:16	disqus_BomfvVnaYy	istheservicedown	Priority Mail package sent July 15th has not had an update since July 20th. Reached out to post office last listed on the tracking and they said that it was sent to the distribution center, which at the time was 10-15 days behind in scans. Item was supposed to be delivered between July 23-28. They initially told me to give it until July 31st. July 31st came and went, so I filed a missing mail search and haven‚Äôt heard anything. Was hoping to get an update if possible! Tracking # 9407803699300046569927. Thank you!

I can view the tracking via SpeedPak, but there is no correlating USPS tracking number to refer to once the packages hit the US, in which it came really quick from China. The SpeedPak boxes numbers are ES10009505459510001010001F0N and ES10009522190420001010001G0N. I tried to track them by informed Mail, but I keep getting an error . It keeps saying that "our system is experiencing problems. Please try again later".P.S. I have one more SpeedPak package ES10009530377490001010001C0N that has only been stuck in West Sacramento, CA since August 5th, but I am getting the feeling it may also get lost.

When should I reach out to the seller?

5024047590	2020-08-09T18:53:22	disqus_9d5o1KRzER	istheservicedown	Thanks. I will phone them tomorrow. Also, is the staff who collecting mails for the mail box outside on the street and the staff who collecting mail/packages in the postal office the same person? If not, at least either the packages I dropped off on the mail box outside or postal office should have been scanned. Or all the staffs are not scanning packages on 7/28 at 90012 area?? Are all collected mails in same area go to the same sorting facility? Thank you.

5024101910	2020-08-09T19:45:46	disqus_qFIbOiwDf7	istheservicedown	Having the same issues as a lot of people here. My package is over a week late. Shows it is on the truck and should be here by the end of the day and it never arrives. I've done everything I can from contacting the shipper and deliverer, to emailing corporate. Fedex says it is due to COVID but just a couple weeks ago they had no problems shipping several orders that came from the same shipper.I believe the issue lies in signatures. This order requires one and I think Fedex is pushing those deliveries aside. This does not make much sense since they said on their website that they are bypassing signatures, but perhaps my shipper is forcing them to get one. I really don't know right now but the entire experience is pretty frustrating. I've even offered to come pick the package up. Come on Fedex, just call or email your customers and let us come pick our packages up.
5024103643	2020-08-09T19:47:30	disqus_qFIbOiwDf7	istheservicedown	I guarantee it is just sitting at the facility and is never actually on the truck. That is what has happened to me.

I need to use my computer. I have unplugged, tried to reset, etc...multiple times, and still get "FAILURE" scrolling across after plugging back in.  If you are able to send that message through my router, why can't they fix this???  They charge way too much for this type of inconvenience, and better credit the missed days of service. Absolutely awful. Don't bother calling, you will just get a message explaining "an outage has been detected in your area, we appreciate your patience", and then it hangs up on you.  WE HAVE NO PATIENCE ANYMORE!!!  I have electricity, but cannot even watch the news, go online, etc...  I wonder if Frontier is too busy with new customers to come install today.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!  People need to work from their computers, and I am not going and sitting at some coffee shop hotspot. GET IT TOGETHER OPTIMUM!!!!  You were awful before, and even worse now.  If I could have taken Spectrum with me, I would have. Their customer service is phenomenal, and they automatically credit your account for anything that disrupts service.  What do I do now?  Even when the technician installed this crap in December, they had horrible things to say.  Your own employees don't like the company, think the service sucks, and willingly go on about how terrible optimum or alticeor whatever your company's name is.

5025059050	2020-08-10T16:33:52	None	istheservicedown	Power has been back up since last week, but no internet.  We are in Oyster Bay.  Was only able to reach a chat bot that was of no help whatsoever.  Please invest in people.  And find an effective and honest way to communicate when outages can be expected to be resolved.  It looks as though Optimum was not at all prepared, and I wonder if you have cut personnel.  Not sure what else would explain the lack of communication and the lack of workers out and about fixing things.  The webpage you have now created about the outage doesn't even have an easy way to report if service is down.  But  you sure can purchase service from that page (not the best marketing strategy!)

Because if they told you that it would show up that it went to your local office. Personally in my opinion they definitely don't know what they are talking about! and also no arrival scan to the main local office!Max

5025878386	2020-08-11T06:56:07	disqus_kvT5iGPYD7	istheservicedown	Hey again Max,Any idea if Atlanta distribution is majorly backed up at well? After waiting 7 days with no scan, the package finally departed Denver distribution on the morning of the 7th. It‚Äôs now the 11th and No scan for arrival in Atlanta. Meanwhile, a package sent from much closer arrived in Atlanta distribution on time and moved through with no problems. Would the distribution center be backed up more with incoming plane shipments than more local ones coming by truck? Just trying to figure out how much longer I should expect to wait on this important package. Thanks again for all of your help.Edit: 9506 1130 0592 0212 1260 74 for reference

I don't pay for electricity I didn use or have access too due to inclement weather so why can't telecom's prorate their services based on the actual availability time of the purchased service based on the product's units (time)...aka, 98% actual service availablity time ler billings cycle = 98% of total cost per billing cycle? Monoplies gonna monopolize I guess, lol?...satirical but lack of competition seems reasonable factor at least

I did respond to your questions if you look further down this page. However, I now have new information. I called the Peoria post office and they provided me with a dispatch label ID and they thought that the container holding the package never left Palatine. Do you have a co-worker who could intervene while you are on vacation and pull the package aside so I could drive to Palatine, pick up the package, and drive it to my addressee in Peoria? Please, Max, save me from total despair on this 30 day nightmare.

I would guess that it is really backed up, priority mail packages aren't even coming up as scanned as they typically would on my USPS informed delivery.

5030007350	2020-08-14T08:19:04	bluemoondragonfly	istheservicedown	Yes, Spectrum internet is down in Grover Beach - 93433 - there must be a breeze... Seriously - For what I pay and 80 % of the time endless buffering - cashe overflow because it takes so long to connect servers time out.. Or like now - It's down - and no one gets any refund for their failure to provide Service as Advertised.  I am rebooting their Hub 2-3 times a week because it just freezes up and stops responding. Spectrum is so much slower than Charter - Perhaps not able to keep up with increased demand since Covid? Oh wait, didn't that start SIX MONTHS AGO!? Honestly - I haven't found any company significantly better. Perhaps the old infrastructure that keeps getting bandaids and bubblegum might just need to be replaced. Oops - there goes the Corporate Salaries and Shareholder profits--at this rate - those are likely to disappear as well.

Depending on location.  Here is the thing. The distribution box is eventually ran up to a pole and it runs to a CTMS box if the CTMS box has no power there is no internet possible.  If the pole fell with wires and lost power or cable wire is damaged and pulled apart. Mediacom tech's can't go near it for safety reasons. The power company has to fix their poles and wires first before tech's can go up the pole to restore service.

They keep pushing the time for return of service further and further, it went out day before yesterday for the same reason. It also goes down almost nightly for about 3 or so hours between 12am and about 5am, give or take . For such an expensive service that has a monopoly on our entire neighborhood, I'm pretty disgusted. Been stuck with this overpriced unreliable slow service for years now and am ready for some good old fashioned Capitalism to do what it is MEANT to do (but never does because no one regulates these corporations) and bring in some competition like it's supposed to to keep these people from charging outrageously for such a poorly maintained product. And as my kids' return to school looms and they go full virtual the pressure will be on for Xfinity to show they use all that obscene amount of monthly money we pay them to give us the best service they can or things are going to get nasty with A LOT of parents, teachers, and hell the state itself, my friends. School is required by law, people. Get your shit straight, Xfinity, it's about to be on. And it better stay on.

5033429286	2020-08-17T04:03:02	None	istheservicedown	For the past 2 months, Comcast internet has been mediocre. It cuts out randomly throughout the day MULTIPLE times, and whenever you call the customer service or support team, they simply try to ‚Äúreset‚Äù your modem with a refresh signal from their own computers. FUN FACT: WE CAN ALREADY DO THAT OURSELVES THROUGH THE XFINITY APP!!! They can never seem to give you an explanation of what‚Äôs really going on with their internet service, and quite frankly, I‚Äôve gotten fed up with this mess. Working from home with an unreliable internet connection is killing any chances of me signing with Xfinity ever again.

5033810908	2020-08-17T14:10:52	None	istheservicedown	Update on my package: I was expecting a priority package mailed from San Francisco to LA on 7/14. The package arrived in LA DC the next day and then the status was stuck in transit. Filed a help form and missing mailed search a week or two later but no one in USPS knew where the package was. Filed a claim on the third week and got a check from usps for the insurance+postage three days later. While I thought my package was lost, it suddenly arrived at my post office and were out for delivery this morning. The package literally sat in the distribution center for 4.5 weeks!!! It's very frustrating but I thank Max for your help here, you have brought comfort to a lot of anxious souls!

It's a 1/4 the speed it was before the merger and it's impossible to stream any video with constant buffering, takes forever to even send a picture etc! Keeps going to "ROAM" in our own house. Been on the phone with Sprint for the last week for hours! They act like nothing is wrong and try and have me update profile and reboot phone (like I don't do that every 5 minutes the way it is to try and get DATA to work). My household is dependent on the internet and hot spots with a home business and students and a teacher. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE and something has to be done!

To be specific, a package sent to me from LV, NV to me in Grover Beach, CA arrived in Valencia, CA around 2:30 a.m. Saturday and was supposed to be delivered by 8:00 p.m. Sunday August 16.  Tracking all the while showed it had just left Velencia.  Now it does say delivery delayed and to expect it by 8:00 p.m. on August 22.  Valencia and Grover Beach are not all that far apart, say 150 miles.  Are they shipping it via Desert Tortoise and not truck?

Not trying to toot my own horn, but ive networked several computer systems & designed home theaters so Im a fairly tech savvy person. However all of that means nothing if the actual service you are working with isn't functioning properly at all. It's like a chef trying to make a filet menion with a sirloin.

I wonder does that mean the package could be delivered without scanning? Or is it still in the facility because it cannot be scanned by the sorting machine?Also, I have filed a missing mail search request and a insurance claim. Will that help find my package? Thanks!Helen

Thank GOD I had a back up phone through my employer with Verizon that NEVER gave me any issues. No Network at all. It came came back on last night, but in its limited poor service version that I have been experiencing for the last 2-3 weeks now. My phone stays on roaming and the service is just GOD awful. I has been declining since the merger. I have been a Sprint cusomer for almost 20 years now. I am REALLY THINKING ANOUT LEAVING. I am getting no answers from Customer Service. When I called last week, they said, we are inthe process of switching towers - THEY SHOULD HAVE INFORMED CUSTOMERS that there could possibly be a disruption in service because of this. I had no ide awho I was talking to Sprint or T Mobile. NEVER was a fan of T Mobile and this may be the deal breaker for me.

I keep getting a delivery date and then on that date, I wait and about midway through the day I get another message telling me it is delayed.  I have been on Facebook reading peoples posts and they are having the same issues.  What on earth is going on.  Federal Express used to be the leader in getting packages out on time and now they are failing!  I am so disappointed.  The customer service is the worst!!  I am sick and tired of hearing that the delays are because of COVID.  It is unacceptable and just an excuse that is being worn out.  Once the COVID is over, some of these companies that are taking advantage of the situation will be the ones suffering.  People remember how they were treated durning this time.

5037102606	2020-08-19T20:00:55	nathandipaola	istheservicedown	Hi Max, first of all keep up the good work, you are helping so many people. I have a package that has been in transit since 7/26 #9405508205497041683985. I have submitted a service request and they resolved my query, but just gave me the same info I get when I search the tracking number. I have filed a missing mail claim but that has been over a week too and no response. I understand CA facilities are very backed up. I am wanting to know is 3-4 weeks late the new normal. Its a big package so I am not sure if they are delivered differently to regular mail. All I can do is wait I guess.Once again thank you for your time.
5037115180	2020-08-19T20:10:36	disqus_zeSAXyKWcH	istheservicedown	Yes. It's basic physics. The cable companies (no pun intended) have been getting away with throttling, and find ways to use Mbps vs actual bandwidth for marketing reasons. Copper-based systems are about to be put to their toughest test to date.
5037118875	2020-08-19T20:13:29	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Thanks Nathan i am trying very hard hereI see it's been a very long time!In my opinion it might still be there at Mustang OK never really departed because it may have been damaged and awaiting repair If you ever decide to call again please tell them to check the Nixie /Re- wrap area it might be there just waiting to be repairedIn my facility i have found quite a fewThe next possibility is it went to the next facility but not scanned as arrived because that facility may be backed up and the last possibility the contents may have been separated from the package or the address label became scuffed or ripped off during shippingI see you have filed a claim and it might be weeks if you hear somethinghopefully the tracking number is still on there and not damaged and if that's the case you will receive itMax
5037121098	2020-08-19T20:15:05	None	istheservicedown	I really don't see how I can pay for service that it is this poor. This is bad engineering and irresponsible investment... in other words, profit mongering of the most eggregious and monopolistic variety. There will come a time of choice someday up here and when it gets here, Spectrum is history. Until then I see them as the enemy, not the friend.
5037127812	2020-08-19T20:20:11	staceybuckelew	istheservicedown	Thanks Max! I appreciate your quick response here, and your willingness to keep us all informed! I just called them but no answer. Will keep trying - thanks!

5037228984	2020-08-19T21:22:24	neilcouey	istheservicedown	Almost a week now with poop for service in Brazoria County, Texas. Spent 45 minutes waiting for online chat agent from Boost "owned by Dish since July 1, 2020" and finally got to chat with a girl in the Philippines... yippie. The new norm will now be Dish's apathetic customer service slave labor and their over-sold service which functions just enough to keep people from going through the hassle of switching providers. Wife and I both have same phones.. Galaxy S8+ and are having the same issues with no network and the phone only able to use wifi. Tried the ##72786# reset and can get re-connected to network long enough to send a few texts and calls till same issue comes up and we have to repeat the process. Been with Boost for a long time and had been happy enough till about a week ago. Dummy in the Philippines says everything A-OK, sorry you no happy... WTF?

Many times during the week I‚Äôm in the 40‚Äôs and 50mbps range! I fight my way through the system and FINALLY get a live body. We go through the same BS every time. They recycle my modem, then I do it. It doesn‚Äôt help. We schedule a tech. They send out a CLUELESS contractor that tells me it‚Äôs all working as well as it can. Bottom line: Suddenlink is a monopoly in this area (Tyler Texas)  for internet service and they‚Äôre taking FULL advantage of it. I guess I‚Äôll take up reading books for entertainment and sending my mail through the USPS?

I'm so exhausted contacting optimum everyday.From what a optimum tech said was that another tech put all the wires up (tree took down everything) but for some unknown reason, that tech didn't finish the installation. Everyone who has optimum down my street should also be experiencing same thing...but I'm betting they don't realize that its a cable problem over here and were probably told they need repair appt at their home....thats what they originally told me.

5038364004	2020-08-20T17:33:24	rhonda_cline	istheservicedown	I am customer service rep for a business and we have 7 packages that shipped to Canada from Kansas. Each package reached Chicago and was scanned July 16 - July 27 (2 on the 16th, 3 on the 24th, 1 each on the 17th and 24th) - none of these packages show any further scans or updates.We and our customers are justifiably concerned - any insight on what might be happening here. (All shipped USPS First Class) - Are they still in Chicago after 30 days?? In transit without the departing scan?
5038365957	2020-08-20T17:34:51	None	istheservicedown	Shipped 2-3 day Priority Mail package on Aug 9th to Ohio.  Was in Wichita KS same day, then have not seen any updates since the 11th.

I had to obtain his death certificate just to pay my first bill! Ntm they added cable and phone which I never asked for! Then I complained constantly for 2 months because of sub-par internet speeds that were not meeting my pay bracket... Then the modem died. (I was paying for high-speed which I was not getting cause they gave me someone's old worn out router... It takes a Looong time to burn out a wificard. Lol) Service is always in and out... I have spent up to six hours of my time dealing with their stupidity in the last 4 month's... They have robbed me of several work days. (In my profession I stream online... My time is worth $150-200 per hour.) I have complained multiple times... Filled out formal complaints... Sent private emails... Called and complained. I've never even got an apology let alone compensation for all the time, money, and psychological distress they have caused me. I'm afraid to switch carriers because there are many stories online that "even if you cancel... They will continue to bill you... And if you don't pay they just destroy your credit. Spectrum cable is run by criminals that know they can do what ever they want because nobody has the time or resources to argue with them. Sry you had to get involved with these idiots. I'm just doing my best to distribute my story and warn others... I promised to tell the world if they didn't compensate me... Unlike them... I keep my promises.

5039131785	2020-08-21T06:19:44	None	istheservicedown	Service is down because of "maintenance" in London,  Ohio but should be up by the morning.  This is the 2nd time in 2 weeks however we didn't experience issues until a semi took down 4 telephone poles and tearing electrical boxes off homes a few weeks ago. Maintenance shouldn't take 1230am until the sun rises. Perhaps letting customers know of planned outages would decrease calls, frustration and hold times and result better customer satisfaction.

With all these problems fewer people will order anything from the USA and go elsewhere.

5039285999	2020-08-21T10:53:07	None	istheservicedown	The mail is so messed up right now.  Yesterday, I received two large packages that the USPS tracking says they haven‚Äôt even received yet, but I‚Äôm still waiting for packages from April and July, and I‚Äôm starting to worry that the next one (all from my son) will not show up either.  I have noticed that I have no trouble getting my Amazon packages, but privately shipped packages take forever to show up, if they show up at all.  I think I‚Äôm going to have my son mail my packages in re-used Amazon packages from now on.  Max, thank you for your help previously.  USPS says the military has my packages, but the military doesn‚Äôt have any phone numbers for me to call and pester people.  I did one search through the military and they just directed me back to the USPS.  I‚Äôm beyond frustrated.

Now I understand Covid-19 slowdown and all but USPS refuses to take responsibility because technically it hasn't passed the threshold into their delivery purview ("still in customs processing"). So, my packages are probably stuck in bin #999 out of 1000. Oh yeah, the tracking codes from these packages also completely disappeared from my "Informed Delivery" because they can't be bothered to keep track of something stuck for a possibly long time.

The tracking info says it departed Memphis on August 17 but is stuck at "in transit, arriving late" since then.  It is now August 21. The original estimated arrival date was August 12.

5040090741	2020-08-21T22:29:49	None	istheservicedown	We haven't had internet for over 2 weeks in Randlman, NC.  My child can't go to school. Centurylink owns the rights to our area, so we have no other available choices for internet.  We pay over 100.00 a month for internet speeds at about 4.  no higher.   No one would CHOOSE to pay that amount for that slow internet.  I feel my rights are violated and Centurylink if price gouging because they know we can't get internet from anyone else in my area.   What is worse is Centurylink has not  responded to me once.  I have made 20 calls and 12 work order tickets, tickets get cancelled with no reason given and no one will call me back. I've been told 7 times a supervisor will call me back, but it has not happened.  I'm really sick of being taken advantage of as a consumer.  My only hope is if I sell my house and move. Century link should not be able to "hold us hostage to them" this way.  I would cancel in a second if I had another option.    instead we sit here, child can't go to school and we have no internet and not one word as to if or when it will be restored.  Oh and they drafted 105.00 from my account today even though I stopped auto pay.  This is REDICULOUS. Does anyone know anything I can do to get another provider allowed in our area?

No delivery. Got My UPS notice that delivery was scheduled by 8 pm last night. No Delivery. Tried to cut and past the tracking number for alternative delivery, or I would drive 25 mins to the local distribution facility. Tracking numbers not recognized. Last night delivery update went to delayed for weather or emergency. Weather this last week in KC is as nice as San Diego is all year. No storms within a 100 mile radius, and packages weren't routed through Iowa where the derecho hit. Did get to talk to a nice person in India, who said a dispatch person would call within an hour. My frustration is how hard it is to talk to a human, how you can't talk to dispatch directly in KC, KS and that it looks like after they drop the ball on day 1, they put it on the back of the route on day 2, etc. One item is heat sensitive and is shipped in a styrofoam container with a cool gel pack. It's now long past the cool phase. Is there a work slow-down that we aren't being made aware of?

5040730464	2020-08-22T14:25:39	None	istheservicedown	This is the 3rd time in 9 months that I have had delivery issues (all sent Priority Express Overnight) from the Macon Distribution Center. I live in Ellaville, 45 mins away. The last time I had to drive there and pick it up on a Saturday or else it wouldn't have been delivered until Monday, 4 days late!! Now I have a package that has disappeared into thin air! It arrived there Thursday at 10:00 am where a real person scanned it in, then it showed in transit at 1:37 pm which is a computer generated scan and only means it was put on the truck because my town only gets one mail delivery a day in the AM....Package didn't arrive and my postmaster has called or emailed every town around, talked to the Express people in Macon (I did too and they don't give a shit and basically said they have no idea where it is and can't do anything about it!).  I have tried contacting Consumer Affairs and have left two messages with no return call so now what??? This was medication i accidentally left in Texas last week and my roomate was sending to me. I've now been out for a week and there is no resolution in sight, so now what???? Tracking EJ120623400US.  IDK who else to even contact because my postmaster has already called his supervisor that is over the distribution center as well and supposedly everyone is looking for it. This is bs and their attitudes suck.  Any ideas for me?? Thanks

Down from here to other counties in TX.  Quick to turn ofd service, but expects customers to understand when service is down.  It seems to happen right after I pay my bill.  Other companies are down too right now.

5040883107	2020-08-22T16:55:31	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Tim  am trying to figure why they are sending it  dead mail?They have the tracking number and they can send it to the customer!I work in this area in my facility and would never send a package that canbe identified with the tracking number..If the contents were separated from the package the package should go back to the sender or the recipient and stamped as received without contents! not thrown to dead mail!!Ridiculous! employees and management not knowing their jobs!Anyway the address for the mail recovery center is 5345 Fulton Industrial Blvd. SW  Atlanta GA 30336 There is no way to contact them by phone or regular mail. The only way is handwritten mail and photos are a great helpLet me tell you also when they can't return items back to the customer they put them on an auction site called govdeals  If you can please contact the USPS again and find out why it went to dead mail that bothers me!!Thanks!Max

5040897574	2020-08-22T17:08:43	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Teresa first of all i am sorry for all your troubles!Employees and managers alike are not paying attention to what they are doing!For one express mail should be put in express mail bags or in a tub and be put on the nose of the trailer when it gets to the distribution center and IMMEDIATELY given to the express clerk for processing! What i think and know what happened to your express package that it was co mingled with the regular priority mail and went to a distribution center it wasn't supposed to go to and ran on the machines and nobody in that facility identified it either! So i see it departed and now will have to wait till it reaches the next facility and hopefully someone smart enough will identify it So now it probably is at the next facility but not scanned as arrived (the container it's in) because that facility may be backed up Teresa believe me i have over 45 years experience and i have seen it all! This bothers me also!!Max

I also had the same question. If they can identify the tracking number, why not forward it on or return it? I've also requested on a separate site that USPS do a search (Search ID #9572645) but haven't heard a response on that yet.  The item was insured. When would you suggest  I initiate a claim on this? Thanks again ... much appreciated!Tim

Then I tried calling numerous times after setting up a business account to inquire what was happening and get all the way through to auto mess and then when it tries to transfer me to a customer service agent is says cannot help you over the phone goodbye. So I logged into my account on my laptop and tried to delete the business account and it delete the business account and my personal account.  What a cluster.

I'm told problem is that a Sprint tower at 2790 Altamesa Blvd. Ft. Worth TX 76133 has been out of service since Aug. 14.  Today is Aug.22.  I bet that tower is not the only one Sprint has in Fort Worth so I really don't understand what the problem is.  Sure makes me question about the reliability of both Sprint and Tello.

Northeast suburbs of Dallas (Richardson, Garland, Wylie, Murphy, Sachse, Rowlette, etc.).  Television is completely unaffected (except things that use wifi, like roku).

5042298130	2020-08-23T20:52:29	DEADtoasterOVEN	istheservicedown	On June 28th I ordered a plantstand from Germany. The last scan was August 13th in NJ. I am starting to get really worried. The last stand I got from Germany was in May and it took a month. It is almost 2 months later and nothing. I called and went down to the local and bigger post office. Not much they can do apparently. My package has to be somewhere. Tracking # CB389110334DE. It was also pretty expensive

5042311387	2020-08-23T21:02:19	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Shana it might be at the next facility and not scanned as arrived because that facility may be backed up..or the possibility it was damaged and is awaiting repair and the last possibility which i hope it isn't  the contents may have been separated from the package and went to the mail recovery center in Atlanta GA right now all you can do is to file a claim or wait and see if it shows up and may take much longer than expectedMax

To save time checking the sites of postal companies manually, I created "Parcels" website and mobile apps which will automatically check every relevant postal, courier and logistics company website on your behalf.  To find out where your parcel is, you need to know only tracking number of your package.What is a tracking number?Tracking number or tracking code is a unique number assigned to each package, which allows you to monitor the movement of the parcel between the countries or even inside one country. Tracking numbers can be international or traceable only within the country of the sender.  The tracking number in the format of the Universal Postal Union looks like RA123456789CN, where the first 2 letters are the type of package and the last 2 letters are the code of the country of origin. Packages with such numbers can be tracked right until delivery. Other shipments can be delivered by courier, transport and logistics companies, and how tracking codes look can vary a lot: CTAFT0000160477YQ, UPAAB000000251682107, AEL10105033654UA, SGADN143797855. Such packages are not always trackable in the recipient's country, and you'll have to wait for notification from the Post Office or a call from a courier company.Tracking eBay ordereBay sellers use multiple delivery and postal companies depending on item price and selected shipping method. Whether it's SpeedPAK, Pitney Bowes, Global Shipping Program, China Post, Winit, Yanwen or any other shipping company we've got your back. Read our extensive guide to tracking eBay orders.Delivery timeWondering how long it will take for your order to arrive to United States, UK, Canada, Australia or any other country? Wonder no more, with our state of the art delivery time estimation algorithm you'll always informed when to expect your parcel. We collect extensive delivery time statistics for each package going into each country and city and will use all of this data to get you most accurate estimated date of arrival.

5043079775	2020-08-24T14:07:36	FireBandit	istheservicedown	Hi Max it is out for delivery this morning.I think part of the issue with people getting nervous is that the Usps tracking lags behind so bad and just not enough updates or details in the updates.I think there needs to be many things fixed with the Usps but better tracking would solve many issues.On that note thank God for dedicated workers like you because just like with any workplace you have your good and bad apples and sadly the good apples end up taking the blame for everyone.I have 2 quick questions.How do I go about requesting a refund on line?I clicked on the link on Usps and put in my tracking number and it says: The Priority Express period has not started for the following numbers (my tracking) and requests must be made 2-30 after the mailing date.I was like huh??Other question..I order this same package every week and used to use just regular priority and it would only take 3 days.I here in the last 2 weeks started paying for express due to reading about so many issues with late priority.Even though this package was express and was still a business day late is the express worth the cost right now or do you think I could stick to priority and possibly not have issues (meaning shipping no more than 4 days between Arizona and Ga).I dont want to take any chances but as a Firefighter in Ga I aint a rich girl lol.

I called to find out they canceled because it turned into a network outage with many people in my area impacted with estimated repair by 8/25. Well, just found out it won't be repaired today. It's delayed to 8/28. That'll be 7 days no internet (WiFi). I can't work without WiFi or use my smart TV or many things in my home without access. With Covid, many people are forced to work from home, like myself. We NEED  internet service to work ok our laptop. This is so unacceptable!!!

One in particular I'm most concerned about. it's a costly item that I cannot be refunded for or repurchase. It was a personal item of my little brothers who has died and it was so hard to track down and find but I did and I was able to buy it. Tracking says it arrived at the origin facility but there's no update of it moving. It was due to arrive Monday. I'm incredibly stressed about this, I filed a help claim which USPS marked resolved after telling me deliver times are weird right now. So it was marked resolved with no resolution. I don't know what to do at this point. I don't know if it arrived at the origin faculty and then was misplaced or lost or if it ever left and just wasn't scanned. I'm losing sleep over this. I'm so scared it's lost. I don't know what to do. Tracking: 9405828206334100114180August 26, 2020 In Transit, Arriving Late Your package will arrive later than expected, but is still on its way.

It's a Spectrum problem. Me and 2 of my neighbors have made a decision to switch. We've told Spectrum for the last 18 months and nothing has gotten any better and they don't care. They charge a lot of money for low grade service. If enough people would get tired of it and drop them, maybe they'd start to get the clue. As it is, they don't care and will continue to offer crap.

It's been over three days without a phone, voicemail, texts or the Verizon app. How can you even get emergency assistance during Hurricane Laura aftermath without phone service? What are the changes of getting a refund on your monthly bill? Probably as good as making a phone call right now. Oh, and just for your information Verizon, my zip code is 70605. That's right smack dab in the middle of HURRICANE LAURA's path in Lake Charles, LA - since you seem to be so clueless. Why not tell the truth that you routed a tower via semi on I10 almost 3 days ago and it is still not up and running. Entergy, Suddenlink and the water company are working faster than you. Hey guys, we're talking about a phone signal for God's sake.

I had to get on my daughter's ATT phone in order to post this comment because I cannot use my phone. This is absolutely ridiculous. What do I pay a phone bill for? To be stranded in the middle of an emergency such as this??? I have never been so disappointed in a cellular service in all my 65 years of life.

I went to my local post office to get an estimate on when it will arrive and they have no idea. They said that multiple people with packages coming through the Anaheim Center have had problems with deliveries. This is really frustrating because it seems like no one actually has a clue where the package is. The tracking number is 9505 5150 6986 0238 7836 57 if anyone has any insight. Thanks.

Sick of Cox blaming everyone for their internet being down. 4 days I have reached out to chat a dozen times had the agents end the chat reset my modem tell me there is no issue in my area. My neighbors and I went door to door asking people in a 17 block radius if they had Cox internet the ones that said yes says their service isn't working right or not at all. Contacted Cox let them know this they didn't care. There is a petition going around okc to get another cable and internet provider here because of these issues so far I have refused to sign it but i am at the point of signing it..i work from home I need my internet as some breadwinner for my family. Since January 4th I've made numerous tech request they keep getting cancelled by Cox not by me at all I don't find out they are cancelled.till I get a.notice in my email. Since Jan 4th I've made 19 tech request that never showed up or were cancelled on Cox end. I have a service request for Sept 1st hopefully they call me and show up. Not to mention I have requested supervisors or managers and have been denied to speak with one. My best friend works with Cox she told me they can not refuse a supervisor request. I asked if she could help me.she said no as she works in the retention department which I understand but this is out of hand.

It shipped via CNE from Shanghai, and spent less time in customs! My CNE tracking number is 3A5V531492350 but I don't have a USPS one, but my package us now in the USPS system. Could you please help?

5052095805	2020-08-31T06:44:00	disqus_3F9wcdicWh	istheservicedown	Hi Max, Thanks for your answer.I did contact Chester's PO by phone, their response was "Due to covid bla bla.."All the packages are First Class.Can you estimate how much is an heck of time? It's been more than a month.Thanks,
5052098655	2020-08-31T06:50:14	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	S C That's going to be hard to determine as like i have stated they are going to process the priority mail first and also in my opinion they are not processing the oldest mail first! To me it doesn't matter if it's first class or priority i think these facilities are processing the mail at random and not checking the placards on each container! Each placard has a date on it and it should always be by the oldest date first and in my opinion very poor management!so the only thing to do is contact consumer affairs if you can and file a complaintMax
5052131784	2020-08-31T07:57:33	disqus_nY4UFZoUlv	istheservicedown	It's been down in Kissimmee since before midnight, I get better reliability from my antenna than I do from Spectrum. I swear every 48 hours in the last six months they've had outages ranging from 15 minutes to 10 hours in length. Sure, kids are restarting school and the weather might not be perfect, but that doesn't excuse the service being worse than satellite television. Leo Getz on Lethal Weapon 2 might have had a point about drive-thrus, but really it's almost EVERY business.

I called and the man told me it would be 2 months to a year before they could do anything.  I guess my grandson doesn't need an education and I don't need to pay bills, etc. I thought I got fast reliable internet and WiFi, but that was 15 years ago and now they don't want to help us, because they have so many new customers. Really how about talking care of us 1st and the new customers later. Or stop selling it if you can't make good on your offer of fast, reliable service.

Since I can‚Äôt get international support from USPS I thought I‚Äôd try here to get an answer. It has been floating around San Francisco all this time. Last tracking update says it‚Äôs departed from a transfer facility. I wanted to know has it left the USA or just to another facility. Australia Post have no information. Tracking number is CH101846537US.I‚Äôve had another parcel sent from the same person which turned up in Australia in 2 weeks. The is was order 2 weeks after the first order on the tracking number I‚Äôve supplied. I just need to find out where it actually is. Hope to get an answer. Cheers

The first was mailed from Louisiana on 8/15 and after arriving in Texas was shipped back to Louisiana. Tracking says it has left Shrevesport but I am wondering if it is caught in a loop?

Then departed Austin TX?Sure wasn't scanned and why wasn't it delivered? these carriers maybe new have no idea what they are doing! Yes your first one looks like it's looping and you will have to contact consumer affairs to have the package pulled manually or it will keep going back and forthIt's the machines that process and read the barcodes and maybe the barcode is bad or the recipients address is too close to the senders address as examplesThe second one was processed through ISC  (it left there) or maybe it didn't and was damaged and is still sitting there Please contact consumer affairs on that one tooMax

Why do you do this to your customers. I pay for 1 gig service. We have a two businesses to run.  We cannot afford this on top of everything else.

So the next day i went down to my local post office and they said it was a mistake? It wasn't delivered and i said if that's the case why does it show a time when it was delivered! They had no answer and my guess is the carrier had it with him scanned it in the truck then forgot about itIt's these new carriers who are not paying attention to what they are doing and i am guessing that's what happened to you and i also had all the extra trackingMax

5054123394	2020-09-01T18:27:46	disqus_6B3Byq0qwK	istheservicedown	Hello, I ordered a domestic package on 920559017554770002307167 on 8/28/2020 and I was told it shipped (label created - pre transit) then this morning 9/1/2020 the tracking is saying Pre-Shipment Info. sent to usps, usps awaiting item. The US Postal Service was electronically notified by the shipper on September 1, 2020 to expect your package for mailing. I was wondering if the shipper only made a label and never gave it to usps or if usps could have not scanned it in? It's supposed to be shipped priority so I'm hoping to find out, not only when I'll receive it, but that it is actually even sent. Thank you for your help!

It most curious that  after 11 am the internet will work but then after 6 pm it suddenly stops as if Suddenlink hits a switch.  I expect my bill to shrink considerably as reliable 24/7 high speed internet is in the service agreement but I have not not received in over a month. Try replacing your infrastructure and hire skilled technicians. Customers dont want people that can only read a script.71037

They don't seem to care. Thy need to update their ancient systems. If you charge people for service then provide what they pay for. Or get out of the way for someone else to come in. So frustrating.

Out of curiosity I decided to track the package yesterday just to find out that this package has made it to Memphis on August 29th. A city that‚Äôs almost 2 hours from me. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday, but never arrived. It‚Äôs now stuck in Memphis. I‚Äôm so sick of this mess happening, it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm not meant to get this package. The package finally moves just to get stuck again in Memphis somewhere. Also this package has been missing so long until it doesn‚Äôt show from start to finish, it‚Äôs only now showing when it arrived to Memphis. The rest of the tracking information was erased. At first it was stuck in California. Will this package ever arrive? 92001902004365000228403873

This time there is an "outage in my area" but no other information. So am I t expect it working tomorrow or tonight? The next day? This is all the time. I've complained even to the FCC along with many other neighbors and friends. All they did was have someone come out whom did not work for Mediacom mind you, and tell us the wiring is old in our community and they won't pay to fix it so we are pretty much screwed and that there is nothing we can do because mediacom holds a contract for our area stating only they are allowed to present service to the community. Last time I checked it was illegal to monopolize things. Just saying. I would LOVE to have Xfinity! When I lived in Rehoboth there were never any interruptions! Perfectly smooth sailing. We pay for the lowest tier of internet now too btw because when we were paying for the highest tier WE DID NOT NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR INTERNET performance! The only difference was that of $100.00 extra. We canceled and went back to our lowest (200mg) because it was insanity to pay for something we weren't getting. We had it about 20 days and they charged us a pro rated bill extra of $149.00!!!!! If I had the option to have another company I wouldn't be here complaining, I would be enjoying my movie I was trying to watch now that everyone is asleep and not hogging the internet. Oh well guess I can't now. I will just stare at the wall instead it will probably be more reliable than my service!

5056611635	2020-09-03T16:08:28	None	istheservicedown	Well played, Optimum. ‚ÄúSystem maintenance‚Äù performed after midnight, early September 4th. After attempting various methods of contacting someone, I was assured via the chat feature that the problem would be resolved by the next morning. More than halfway through my second day of teaching remotely with Zoom, and in-and -out internet service made it completely impossible. I had to change everything on the fly and get creative contacting the students to ensure they at least knew what was happening, and could access their work for the day. On the  second day with new students who are struggling to make adjustments as it is, this is a failure of service with repercussions well beyond the incident itself. And the kids in the town I live in just started today, and I‚Äôve heard from many parents that their kids can‚Äôt connect. Kids on their first day- stressed and anxious already with all of the adjustments demanded of them- failed by an internet provider, of all things. What a cheap shot, Optimum. Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt get much worse than that.

It showed that my pkg was on the truck for delivery on Sun Aug 30th. I just happened to be near the window when a fedex truck passed by my house on Sunday. I waited for the driver to come back by. Well, the driver did come back by and he parked in front of my house. But about a minute later, the driver pulled off!! He never got out of his truck!!! About an hour later, the package status changed to an exception saying customer was not available! Really?!?! That is the biggest lie!!! Today is Sep 3rd and I still have not received that pkg!!

5058340790	2020-09-04T21:38:23	disqus_UdZmTIQt6D	istheservicedown	Complained to the FCC as well. Ocean View basically has no Cable options but Mediacom. No fiber either. From my experience FCC is a waste of taxpayer dollars. I have pingplotter and modem logs showing large amounts of uncorrectables and latency from network node to modem which shows an issue with Mediacom. It‚Äôs a new Arris sb8200 modem although they will probably try to blame it on the modem I‚Äôm sure. The FCC states that Mediacom will reach out but haven‚Äôt heard from them in over a week since contacting the FCC. Also used to have Xfinity and Mediacom is so poor in comparison. They are not held to any standards and no one keeps them in check.

FCC is a waste of taxpayer dollars and did nothing when I reported modem correctables in the billions and constant latency spikes from poor Mediacom infrastructure and loading too many people on the same node. It‚Äôs insane to me that there is no other option in a beach town. You are correct in that that charge more, provide less, and can do so without any intervention

However, I opened my Outlook email yesterday to discover an empty Inbox. Missing 300+ current emails. All other folders are empty except Sent folder, and that was missing every Sent email since May 2017! Customer support was sympathetic, but not able to give me reliable information about solutions. I went online to Windstream.net, and the missing emails were missing there, too, so the problem is not with Outlook.Seems to me Windstream's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding will probably devolve to Chapter 7 before long.

5058887954	2020-09-05T11:10:42	brownsugga30	istheservicedown	Yes they have a problem delivering packages. About a month ago my order made it to the White Marsh location (which is about 15 minutes from my house) and was on the truck for delivery. However, my package was never delivered and within a few days they sent my package back to the sender. I have 2 orders out now and I've gotten the out for delivery email but it was never delivered. One of the packages contain perishable items so I had the option to pick it up so I did. Then I get an email saying it couldn't be delivered because I changed to pick up. My package was suppose to have been delivered 2 days prior to me putting in the request to pick it up from the store. My other package is pretty much lost at this point. I've contacted customer service and they can't help at all smh. I can't stand Fed ex at this point. I wish I had the option to not use this company when ordering online. I may put in that suggestion with companies I purchase from.
5058889818	2020-09-05T11:13:46	brownsugga30	istheservicedown	Same thing happened to me smh. They don't care. Customer service is a joke. The only thing they know is what you see when you click your tracking number
5058976735	2020-09-05T13:14:07	adrianmarshall	istheservicedown	I live in the DFW area and a friend sent a letter from Arlington to just north of Dallas, took two days.  I was sent a license from the state on the same day as others from Austin. It seems it took two days to go all over the state, but I‚Äôm still waiting. Is the Dallas area mail center just slower due to size? It worries me only because I want to make sure the package isn‚Äôt lost.  My letter carrier is the WORST...I get a lot of mail for neighbors and I don‚Äôt want my license going to the wrong address.

My post office is now closed, so I‚Äôm confused as to why this has happened.

The tech today denied any known issues.  9/01/20 tech  walked us through different reset steps and said that due to virus and people working from home and online school - Sprectrum was doing thousand of constant refreshes to work on the overcrowded system.  The people with businesss Internet now using our home internet should not require us to pay for service and be kicked off the internet.  We are told ofent it is our equipment.  It is going to be approx 105 degrees today and I have medical issues and should not have to drive around and possibly be told they do not have the equipment or wait weeks for tech support.  I know that the same issues will likely remain even with new equipment. Why put me through all this when Spectrum can just  come clean and admit the truth.  6 days ago it was the 5G wireless network and often the 2G and esculated to a outage.

Not sure how to explain this other than they are slowing down things on purpose. no way my local PO is "backed up" this many days of mail, when other items usually come in from WPB overnight and get sent right along for delivery the following morning... and just looking at the volume of complaints here, certainly seems there is systemic dysfunction.Judging by the comments and how massively widespread these issues have "suddenly" become, seems it's being done on purpose (my guess, at direction of the postal union which has openly endorsed biden) to create voter dissatisfaction.  Certainly things are not "back to normal" since things were "restored".  "oddly", only seems to be impacting mail items that are NOT: amazon, walmart, perishable food, or bulk corporate junkmail.  I have another package being shipped to me from a small "non-mega retailer", so I will see how that gets handled after it gets picked up and starts moving after labor day.... will be interesting to see if this pattern holds.I hope if there is any evidence found of an organized conspiracy to impede the mail all those involved are ultimately held accountable.18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ1703.Delay or destruction of mail or newspapershttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1703

The Comcast menu offers no choice relevant to my problem.I realize COVID is affecting all commercial transactions, but a huge provider like Comcast needs to do better.

5062247663	2020-09-08T11:05:56	None	istheservicedown	Looks like internet service is finally back up and running this morning in Los Angeles, California at 3:55am but it was out for a full 24 hours before this though. What actually happened? I'm ready to switch service after 10+ years of loyalty. There are just far better service options with much higher mbps than we are currently receiving. And to not at least provide your customers with updates about the status is terrible. So many of us  were left hanging on Labor Day and the day before when many of us work and homeschool from home. I had checked with Spectrum which uses the Verizon towers and they were all cleared for uninterrupted service over the weekend. It's definitely an AT&T issue. Verizon and Spectrum were good to go. Why not AT&T?

So we will not be credited or reimbursed for services down they will continue to charge.  I hate suddenlink.

5064377171	2020-09-09T22:25:47	disqus_uQU8nboD4v	istheservicedown	My cellular phone has had poor service in my home for over 2 months now.  The only way someone can hear me clearly is when I go outside and even that was not effective today.. When I speak with representatives from Verizon, they have no explanation as to why this is happening, especially when historically this was never the case.  I have been a Verizon customer for over 10 years and have never had this problem before.  I believe there is a correlation between my poor cellular connection and the storm that took place several weeks ago, but according to Verizon, there were no power outages reported.  I am at my wits end.  I am trying to work from home, but that has become next to impossible!!!! Mind you, I am still expected to pay full price for this poor service that is giving me nothing but aggravation.

I can't hear people when they call, calls are disconnected/dropped constantly, Wi-Fi not working, even at my home standing 2 ft away from my Xfinity modem, when trying to place a call it takes forever to connectI asked a rep at my local MetroPCS store what's going on & how long will service be interrupted & she said it has to do with installation of new 5G towers. Then she proceeded to tell me I need to do a factory reset on my phone to fix the problem. I told her why would I do that?

5065328867	2020-09-10T16:58:43	pattihawkesworth	istheservicedown	Having severe problems connecting to internet and with service on my phone for last week.  Have "bundle" with AT&T that I pay for, but spotty or no service - I have to rely on hotspot for wifi, which is the only way I get internet. I've rebooted my hotspot 12-14 times today and FINALLY was able to get on, but this is ridiculous.  I am located in Ocala, FL, near Williston (but still in Marion County).  I have tried contacting customer service, and those idiots tell me to go on the internet and report my problem.  How in the world do you do that when you CAN'T GET ON THE INTERNET ON YOUR COMPUUTER OR YOUR PHONE????? Your customer service STINKS.  I was on the phone three hours yesterday and got passed around to so many people I lost count, and NONE OF THEM COULD HELP.  Nobody knows what they're doing and none of them speak english well enough to be able to understand, so you simply take a "trip around the world", waiting for each one to pass you on to the next idiot.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE???  i am a Real Estate Broker working from home, and I am losing time and money daily due to your HORRIBLE TECHNICAL SERVICE and DESPICABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

When I finally get a live person,  they tell me som w one is coming out that day and they don't.  What is up Comcast.

Remote schooling has been shut-down because of it...  Shameful.  Calls into customer service have NO ETRO... just "As soon as possible" and NO explanation of what is causing the outage.  WTF Comcast?!?!  Before my retirement, I would have been fired (as an IT Manager) for this type of non-sense.
5065488098	2020-09-10T18:58:53	None	istheservicedown	This is the 3rd week in a row that I am having issues with Federal Express and "Delayed" deliveries.  My perishables will now have been ruined 3 weeks in a row.  There are MAJOR issues here in the Atlanta area and FedEx is making no attempt to fix them.  Customer Service is lacking.  Federal Express is a joke at this point and should be avoided at all costs.  I would recommend that you ask any shipper who they use and request that they use another company.  I also recommend that you contact all shippers and let them know of issues with delivery and log a complaint about them using Fedex when there are other DEPENDABLE services out there that can handle the volume and honor their commitments.  I hope that any company that has a Fed Ex contract evaluate them and/or start requesting refunds on all shipping fees and damaged goods that they have to credit back.

5067138503	2020-09-11T23:25:27	shanalachellelee	istheservicedown	ok so I've got some major issues going on with Verizon. Firstly my husband's phone hasn't worked since August 21st. We contacted Verizon on the 22nd and every day since then. We have been hung up on, lied to, pushed and shoved around and I've even been cussed out. We had an NRB ticket submitted August 22 for the technical issues going on. Which are no data, no service. Initially it was like a switch being flipped on and off every 5-15 minutes. From 1 bar 3g, 2 bar 4g, but mainly no service and 1 bar. Every time i have called i get rude customer service. Like they are horrible and just don't want to do their respective jobs. Before all this happened we had always had perfect signal in this same exact locations. But its honestly like Verizon packed up and left and just didn't care to inform their customers. We have been told that it is a tower down, we are roaming, we are connect to an AT&T tower, we are being bounced to a tower over an our away, that it is the Sim Card, that it's a panel on a tower. We cant get a straight answer to save our lives.. I'm sick of it and we are about to leave Verizon for good.. BTW this is Central Georgia area. 31061 (milledgeville)

Don't even get half of what we're paying for and it's fluctuating constantly. Trying to stream to Twitch results in the bitrate jumping between 6000 and 0. Everything's fine on Cox's speedtests, chances are there's a node getting a ton of noise ruining the connection. I imagine Cox is doing little to fix it though.

5067962903	2020-09-12T18:31:57	atcomputers	istheservicedown	I always recommend to do separate units. Double check with coax on what their current approved DOCSIS cable modems are for whatever service you have, never hurts to plan for future upgrades. You can also save money by buying a used or refurbished one, standalone modems rarely go bad.As far as routers I don't ever recommend consumer grade anymore. They're set for ease of use and speed and gaming and not really security. depending on how technologically advanced you are you may be able to do a lot better with an SMB or SOHO device. PF sense/netgate, microtic, ubiquity. they all have a much deeper learning curve than it's consumer grade one but they have far more options and security features available.

You would think that with the technology they would have batteries to keep the system going longer. Maybe every shift on a rotating basis change them with charged batteries during a power outage. I don't like the way CenturyLink provides reliable customer care.

At first they had a estimated time to fix it by 11 pm on the first day after that states no reported outages in the area and the phone calls continue. Now they are suppose to come out on Wednesday so another 3 days from now. The last time I was out for 9 days and only reason got fixed is because I filed complaints with the FCC and BBB. I wish I could have another provider but there is none in my area. So now I will be without internet for 6 days again... Every month I calling and dealing with this trash company. Oh forgot to say my last 9 day outage was less than 2 weeks ago.

I don‚Äôt live far from West Covina, I live in South Central LA and wondering why is taking long to get updates on my package or for it to get delivered.

5070449251	2020-09-14T19:34:07	disqus_DfrpcISVwA	istheservicedown	Nope - never did.  I logged a service request with the USPS (was on hold for nearly 2 hours).  The investigation was then assigned to my local post office.  I got an email from the local post office stating that it was determined to be a lost package since there have been no more scans since it had been dropped off in Rothschild, WI.  The service request was then marked as closed.SR #14821279

They said it will take up to 8 business days for them to now do their investigation.  Once that is complete, they will refund me my money.  My assumption is that they will file a claim of some sort with the USPS and recoup both of our losses.

I work with Network and engineering, what doesn't make sense to me is that no matter where I am or when I test I always get 5 times higher upload speed. It doesnt make sense, download should be 5 to 10 times faster than upload.Metro by Tmobile what is up with this?????
5070915424	2020-09-15T03:02:12	disqus_wQKXzIPAnG	istheservicedown	Its because they just joined 3 companies all on the same backbone. They used to split the bandwidth and now they put Verizon, T-Mobile amd metro pcs all together. Is ridiculous. So now the people who pay amd have higher bills get better QoS priority.

I'm getting so tired of Spectrum, you get on the phone to report your problems and wait over an hour to speek to a real live person.  That NEVER HAPPENS.  YOUR WATCHING A SHOW AND 30 MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOW IS OFF THE TV GOES BLANK.  IT SAYS LMN IS NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW, TRY BACK LATER.  IM GETTING TIRED OF TRYING BACK LATER.  THEY SAY SPECTRUM IS THE BEST, I NEED SOME PROOF.  $200.00 a month for nothing.  They sure take my money each month out of my account on time.

The biggest complaints on this forum are California facilities as far as your certified letter i sure hope they didn't run it on the DBC'S high speed automation machines! It may have been damaged and didn't depart and also these machines run so fast that the machines may have sprayed the wrong barcode on it and it may be in another state!My daughter mailed a birthday card to her friend in July and she didn't receive it till late August! She texted the envelope to my daughter and sure enough as i had suspected the wrong barcode was sprayed on there twice! So the birthday card was in two different states! and one more thing about in transit!Everything that is scanned and still there in the post office when it runs through the machines is AUTOMATICALLY in transit so please don't go by thatMax

5071986724	2020-09-15T22:12:25	photocrazy	istheservicedown	Sadly since they dropped laws on monopolies, we have limited choices and they don't care about customer service anymore.  Here you have 2 choices,  Centurylink or Comcast.  Since they installed my 1g, I have had to reset it multiple times, much more than the landlines I had.  DirectTv had the best customer service then AT&T took them over it is terrible.  Spent 2 hours on phone with them and then a supervisor before I got an appointment to fix my service.  It used to be everyone provided equipment and service repairs for free, now they charge you to make repairs so they can keep you as a customer.  Customer service no longer exists.

Messing with my ability to work from home or let my grandkids watch their Disney shows.  Luckily they are napping right now.  Two bars on my phone where I usually have 5.  What's up?

5073361922	2020-09-16T22:04:16	adriennefrost	istheservicedown	Out again in Holiday FL. Honestly Spectrum I pay a fortune for service and I totally understand that there are seriously bad storms raging and I get that you have alot of customers to get to but this happens at least once a day and there is no compensation on my bill for all this inconvenience. We live in a time of isolation from the rest of the community and depend upon internet for communication and for many of us that translates to working from home. I was just wondering if you intend to refund some of my hard earned money? Obviously I can't work from home and experience this daily. I need reliable internet. I am communicating on my phone which is a metro pcs. They are basically the least expensive phones you can buy and yet they never lose signal. If metro pcs can maintain connectivity then a huge company like Spectrum can do better

5073982142	2020-09-17T10:53:00	melissakanet	istheservicedown	I think most individuals are frustrated because AT&T says there isn't an issue on their end but many people are having problems with internet after Hurricane Sally came through. If AT&T would admit that there is a problem and that they are working to solve it people will feel better. By saying there isn't a problem it leaves people feeling helpless like they need to find a solution. I live is navarre FL 32566 and haven't had internet since my power came back up.

Maybe it goes through maybe it does not. Also receiving phone calls. I have had these issues ever since att switched to 5G. It happens a the times it seems now which is true. Its just ridiculous actually. Like att ffix your issues and leave it alone once it actually works right. But over all fix the issue at hand for the users of your service.  Like I have fill service like I usually do of 5G. But yet the phone ca thing and the text message thing is the issue. Like I don't know if att has major issues with there towers servers. As well as software. But fix it. It has been quite some times I have these issues since they switched to 5G. So again att fox the issue at hand please and thank you.
5074015507	2020-09-17T11:35:52	disqus_g8oh1GdlEE	istheservicedown	I don't have an outage, but I'm getting the slowest internet speeds I've seen in years. Right now I can't watch a youtube video in 1080 without constant catch ups that drop the resolution down to 480p with no other programs running. I think they're throttling the internet again. Spectrum is awful and sadly they're still the best option here. It's like deciding if you want to die by hypothermia or fire. Cable is dead and I can't wait until a smart company just provides good internet with none of the other garbage so we can get on with streaming and gaming without these awful companies.

5074710644	2020-09-17T20:41:14	disqus_ZOFuR12pCu	istheservicedown	I will never again use this dumpster fire of a delivery service. My package which was supposed to be delivered yesterday has still not arrived not to mention the fact that it has been sitting in Troutdale, Or. For 5 days now and has gone from in transit to now pending with no delivery date. If you can't uphold to your end of the bargain. I.e delivering people there goods in a timely manner then why are you still in business that's literally your only job and you can't do it. And then you have the gall to notify everyone on your website that your raising delivery fees Jan. 4, 2021. For what?! That's knowingly giving someone poor service and charging them even more. I guess thats just the american way what am I saying. But realistically how do you not feel completely embarrassed as a company this is pathetic.

5075880306	2020-09-18T18:15:15	petrjohan	istheservicedown	Out in 67206/7- entering second day. This is Southern Kansas. The Cox idiot tried to tell me that they're  a "Public Utility" so there's nothing consumers can do. Bull. I called the Kansas Public Utilities Commission to inquire about their status as a 'Public Utility". They're not. What they told me is they'd like to be so they can hide behind this sort of problem. What they are is a pseudo utility....in other words however they may think of themselves, they're just another business hoping for our dollars and doing little to get them. I tried to call their headquarters in Atlanta, found there was no number. Called the local Police who called the 'corporate number' they had, got an 'agent' in Twin Falls, Idaho. With that, they sent a car with officers by to 'make sure' they were alright. Seems giving the PD a false number annoys them....I finally got an 'internal' number but they were very unhappy. Here's a comparison; A large corporation here, in Wichita, employs 160,000 people. I can dial their headquarters and get it....maybe they'd like to swallow Cox...without a burp.

5077456256	2020-09-19T21:57:54	None	istheservicedown	This feels like nothing less than pure extortion. I received the equipment from comcast and hooked everything up just fine but the TV screen kept giving me the same error over and over again "RDK-03036". no matter what I tried "RDK-03036" kept coming up. I called the Xfinity help line and they said it was an activation issue so they spent the next hour and a half trying to activate the cable box but of course it didn't work. Eventually the women in SINGAPORE, yes she told me she was in Singapore, said it was my splitter and that they needed to send out a technician to fix the problem and it would cost me $80.00 for the visit.  REALLY!!! $80.00 dollars for what, a SPLITTER.  I called a different cable company, hooked everything up and in 2 hours no more issues.  If any of you have a different cable company in your area, get rid of comcast and change over.  they wont get better until it hits there profits.    Bless you all and good luck.

5077483827	2020-09-19T22:27:58	bridgettewilliamshill	istheservicedown	AT&T internet outage in Arlington. I have called numerous times today without resolution. The whole neighborhood doesn‚Äôt have internet or phone service service but AT&T doesn‚Äôt show an outage. I informed several representatives that there is ongoing construction in the area and the same thing happened 4-5 months ago. We were told there wasn‚Äôt an outage but 2 days later AT&T communicated there was an outage and that they are working to resolve it. If customer service is the focus, AT&T is missing the mark. The level of effort required to resolve an issue is unacceptable. So until AT&T decides there is an outage we are left without internet or phone service. Frustrated in Arlington!!!!

5077494187	2020-09-19T22:39:56	None	istheservicedown	I live in South central MI and the service went from 3 bars to one or none last weekend (Sept 12 - 13). It was fine on Friday and gone by Monday. I can get texts but outgoing calls drop.  I am using Google hangouts to make calls! SO you are losing money and judging by the comments I can see I am not the only customer you are going to lose and never get back!After finding the location of the cell tower from the internet I took a car trip with my phone and another phone that is on Sprint but not active (as a confirmation that it is not the phone) to map the signal strength (I am an engineer and a physicist and a ham radio operator who does antenna experimentation so I am an expert).  I noticed that even near the tower it was extremely spotty and variable. It would be 5 bars one second and two the next even when parked next to the tower. Driving a few hundred yards would make the signal disappear, even when within 2 miles of the tower.The tower is located near the junction of M52 and North Territorial Road in Washtenaw Co. It is on top of one hill and my home is on top of a nearby hill so the signal has always been OK in the past.Please fix this. I do not want to go phone/carrier shopping! You were good until last week but it is a bad joke now!I have had Sprint for almost 10 years but probably NOT for much longer!

Today is Sunday, 9-20 at 5:45 P.M. Neighborhood telephone service below Belle Chasse, LA, was restored within 24 hours in my parents neighborhood, yet, my elderly parents are still without phone service.  Their grandson went to their home to trouble shoot and make sure it was not an issue with the phone inside the house.  It is on the telephone company's side. He has called, but nothing has happened and the issue is still unresolved.  My elderly mother flagged down an AT&T worker in the neighborhoogd today and explained the issue to him and asked why everyone else had phone service and she still did not.  His reply to her was "Your guess is as good as mine, but I'll pass on the information."  How helpful and caring of him!  The road on the extra mile is never crowded!I am their daughter and have also attempted to call today, but AT&T is not available on Sundays.  I plan to call tomorrow at 7 A.M. when AT&T opens.  There was no issue due to hurricane Sally.  This outage was due to a driver hitting a pole.

Their  service is really pathetic and frankly the only reason they can get away with this is because there is limited options for internet in rural areas.

Technician came out last week and told us that he fixed an issue with our lines. That was less than a week ago. It‚Äôs gone down at least 2-3 times since. I switched to Spectrum from Google Fiber a month ago to save money and I really regret it. Sadly, other than the very small limited area that Google Fiber is available here, Spectrum is our only option. Pretty sad for a supposed ‚Äútech city.‚Äù To make matters worse, cell phone coverage is also poor here and without WiFi, my phone doesn‚Äôt work where I‚Äôm living downtown.

5081699980	2020-09-23T06:58:22	None	istheservicedown	Hi Max.  I just wanted to let you know that one of my packages finally arrived.  This is the one that shipped in mid-July, sat in Chicago for a month and then got sent to Florida, where I assumed it was left sitting for 20+ days.  Nope.  It went all the way to Greenland before finally arriving here.  The MPO doesn‚Äôt do scans mid-ship, so I have no idea of where/when it traveled, but it is finally here.  I made some phone calls about the one still missing since April.  It sounds like someone is in a lot of trouble for not helping me initially.  Let‚Äôs hope they will discover my package and get it to me.  Thank you again for your help!

Have you had any of my colleagues out to try and repair the coax lines or swap the equipment? I know during this time of Covid no one wants someone in their home, but we could always just check the lines outside that go into your home. As service techs, we honestly hate to hear when one of the subscribers has bad service because we know we can fix it. I know I can't do much from my keyboard, but just I just wanted to reach out.

Maybe it's not authorized because Mediacom here has been down for a week, so am going in via my phone.  Doing that worked fine until now, but now I'm locked out.  Please fix this so I can keep tabs.

5082988717	2020-09-24T03:51:51	None	istheservicedown	I've had this problem recently, too. Also, sometimes the message says "The Rockstar Games services are unavailable right now" if even there's no outage. Here's the solution on PC:1.) With your game NOT RUNNING, go to your Profile folder in Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\Profiles2.) First, you can try only deleting CFG.DAT but that doesn't always fully solve the issue. But if you don't mind <u>resetting your game settings</u>, you can/should also delete PC_SETTINGS.BIN Your graphics settings are separate (settings.xml in GTA V folder), so don't worry about those getting reset. Do not worry about deleting the files I mentioned. The client just regenerates them if they are missing.----a.) On console, hold the LB and RB bumpers ("1" buttons) as soon as you start the game. For both console, and PC if you deleted the PC_SETTINGS file, you should see the calibration screen after the R* logo. This mean you were successful.b.) On PC, the first time you load in, do not change settings on the Landing Page. Instead, choose Story Mode, and load into Story Mode, and then change your settings. Use the Pause Menu to go to Online and go to an INVITE ONLY or CLOSED CREW/FRIEND session to ensure you will NOT be exposed to modders or people with broken/corrupted/glitched clients. Once you load in successfully, close your game. Now BACK UP the PC_SETTINGS.BIN file (the CFG.DAT doesn't matter) so you can just close the client, delete CFG.DAT, and replace the PC_SETTINGS.BIN file if you ever have any issues again. --ALSO, PSA: If you ever download a full/completed/modified SAVEFILE from anywhere or anyone else, <u><b>DO NOT</b></u> USE THEIR PC_SETTINGS.BIN or CFG.DAT files from the profile. Discard/delete them immediately! Or it can cause various client issues or lock you out from Online without a ban (soft lock).

I dropped it off at my post office Monday and it's been "In Transit" since. Or am I super lucky and it's already entered the military post as it's final destination is an APO. Thanks for the help!
5084634049	2020-09-25T11:49:42	None	istheservicedown	My phone is my livelihood and I'm losing hundreds of dollars a day every time this happens. Clients can't get through.  This is atrocious on Verizon's part. We should all get free service for a year. For internet or data not to work... to have a 1x and the phone say no network available. Which led me to having to do a factory reset when its obviously a nationwide issue. I have friends who work in telecommunications for Verizon and they said Verizon is out of work until March. I take it there will be lawsuits and lots of litigation. I want the owner of Verizon fired.

A bot-net is a type of a.i. virus that works as a network, taking over entire networks and acting as one big organism. I hear it is Russian military and I'm worried, because news from Venezuela says their own government has stated the vaccine as a "<blockquote>Russian vaccine which they will not be taking because Russia is trying to use them as guinea pigs."</blockquote>

To save time checking the sites of postal companies manually, I created "Parcels" website and mobile apps which will automatically check every relevant postal, courier and logistics company website on your behalf.  To find out where your parcel is, you need to know only tracking number of your package.What is a tracking number?Tracking number or tracking code is a unique number assigned to each package, which allows you to monitor the movement of the parcel between the countries or even inside one country. Tracking numbers can be international or traceable only within the country of the sender.  The tracking number in the format of the Universal Postal Union looks like RA123456789CN, where the first 2 letters are the type of package and the last 2 letters are the code of the country of origin. Packages with such numbers can be tracked right until delivery. Other shipments can be delivered by courier, transport and logistics companies, and how tracking codes look can vary a lot: CTAFT0000160477YQ, UPAAB000000251682107, AEL10105033654UA, SGADN143797855. Such packages are not always trackable in the recipient's country, and you'll have to wait for notification from the Post Office or a call from a courier company.Tracking eBay ordereBay sellers use multiple delivery and postal companies depending on item price and selected shipping method. Whether it's SpeedPAK, Pitney Bowes, Global Shipping Program, China Post, Winit, Yanwen or any other shipping company we've got your back. Read our extensive guide to tracking eBay orders.Delivery timeWondering how long it will take for your order to arrive to United States, UK, Canada, Australia or any other country? Wonder no more, with our state of the art delivery time estimation algorithm you'll always informed when to expect your parcel. We collect extensive delivery time statistics for each package going into each country and city and will use all of this data to get you most accurate estimated date of arrival.

Since Sept. 15th my AT&T Landline Service for my home Telephone Has NOT been working!. üôÄüò° I have already called up AT&T Repair Service Dept. 5 times & spoken with several persons there (after being "bounced around to other AT&T Depts."). (AT&T Repair Ticket # NSOW5M29). My last phone call to AT&T Repair Dept. was yesterday Sept. 25th. Every time I called they told me the Same Response "AT&T Technicians are still working on fixing the Outside Cables & Service 'should be' Restored by Sept. 28th (Mon.)." Each day, AT&T has "moved up their Service Restoration Date & Timeline".It SHOULD NOT Take this long for AT&T Technicians to Fix this problem & Restore my Service! üò° I have been using my AT&T Cellphone to make & receive calls (with a lot of "Dropped Calls."). Since 1992, I have been a long time & "loyal" AT&T Customer (with my & my Father's Landline Home Telephone Service, 6 AT&T Cellphones between my father & myself & Internet Service). AT&T has Terrible Repair Service & It's Customer Service Dept. personnel Stink! After all of these years having AT&T Service for my Home Telephone, my Cellphones & Internet Service, I feel like switching to AT&T's Competitor XFINITY/COMCAST. Overall, They will offer me Better Overall Service for a Better Price.

5088217680	2020-09-28T06:48:36	None	istheservicedown	My package is taking so long. It's been 6 days it says it's still in texas! Is the ups in texas worthless? Do they need better workers seems like it seeing as it was basically lost for 3 days out of the 6 days it's been in transit. They even took the package from the BS in Houston and then brought it right back and now they took it out again and they have not updated it scanned it in like two days or three days. I've had no problems with any UPS people many things I have bought on chewy.com and Amazon and walmart.com all of them came in a decent amount of time sometimes faster or slower than the original scheduled time but the latest they ever were was maybe a day or two. I've had UBS from All over America and I got to say the one in Texas is not only the slowest but the most unorganized one of them all I literally have had no UPS in my life lose my package for 3 days straight or take it from the station just to return it later on that day and then take it out again in the next day like a retard. I feel bad for anybody that lives in Texas because their ups is the biggest piece of crap in the whole entire United States of America they should be ashamed of themselves this crap is atrocious!

5089241297	2020-09-28T22:55:18	6ftOompa	istheservicedown	Issue started on 09-28-2020: Roku built into TCL TV. Menu system and streaming channel navigation seem to work. Problem exists when media starts playing, either stuck on buffering (25%, 90%, etc) or "plays" a black screen. One movie's timeline progressed while streaming but no video or audio was coming through. Rebooted entire network. No available updates to Roku system.
5089250846	2020-09-28T23:04:58	None	istheservicedown	Corporate shill detected.The issue isn't that we don't have internet. The issue is that we had internet when the power was restored and then lost it the next day. The problem is that there are not mediacom service vehicles on the road, but AT&T are out here in their own bucket trucks moving debris to work on their systems. The problem is that for every mediacom truck I HAVE seen, I've seen (literally) 50 AT&T trucks and workers. Even the areas without power have internet already, provided they have AT&T. Nobody is being ungrateful. In this day and age internet is a necessity, especially during the COVID pandemic, I don't feel the need to explain why. When the service you pay for is disconnected and there is not communication from the provider there is a problem.

5089945072	2020-09-29T14:29:38	disqus_3Ntk9RfKny	istheservicedown	Central Ohio.  My phone has bad coverage.  Actually, not just my phone, anyone I talk to who uses Sprint.  Calls drop, people can't hear me, I can't send emails out with attachments without them getting stuck in my Outbox.  I also can't be on the phone and send an email or get on the internet.  How can this be acceptable cell phone service in 2020?  Must be nice to make billions each year and invest so little and have people just accept crappy service and still pay you.

Before I had discovered we had no internet I spent an hour on the phone with a Cox tech trying to get my internet working, I got disconnected and decided to see if there was a report of an outage in our area and there was, why couldn't the tech tell me that. Exterlemely frustrating and I am sure they will not reduce my bill for this month, they will still charge me a full months usage despite them not delivery the service I have paid for!! Right now I am burning through my AT&T data plan just so i can work remotely from home.

5091650913	2020-09-30T17:00:24	vrspock	istheservicedown	Actually there ARE laws that do just that.  We have miles and miles of cable internet in our area the was subleased by Comcast to a now non-existent hole in the wall competitor that is now bankrupt.  Guess what?  No one can light up that cable and provide better services to the areas those cables exist because of dumbass regulations.I know a local company that even offered to run fiber for a local ISP in our area to get them to expand their fiber coverage.  It was a no go because of regulations.I dropped about $1300 to get fiber build out to my office in the middle of town because we required 100/100 synchronous connection minimum for what we do.  That was through a local ISP that has awesome service.  That's capitalism at work.  Sometimes they will do it and sometimes they can't because of stupid regulations.  Sometimes you can offer them $1 million cold hard cash and they can't do it because of regulations.So how, exactly, is capitalism failing?   Monopolies are illegal under our capitalistic laws, but yet Charter and Comcast cannot co-exist in the same coverage area around here.  I don't get it.  I have lived in areas before where I had three different cable companies, two local telephone companies and two or three other options.  Back in the day I just dropped thousands of dollars into getting a T1 1.5Mbps dedicated loop from one of the backbone carriers to my home and office when everyone else had 56Kbps dialup connections.Now it's a royal pain in the ass to get what you want where you want it no matter how much money you throw at it.  We have had to get politicians involved in putting pressure on the right spots in order to get crap done.  That's certainly not because of capitalism.  We have had to launch slander campaigns against certain ISPs with absolute pure abandonment to get crap done.  Why is that?  Not capitalism.  Dumbass regulations.Of course, businesses thinking that they can just send everyone home to work when their home internet is on a non-dedicated shared node vs either a dedicated node or an SD-WAN configuration for the business is not very smart either.  There's a reason why business infrastructure costs more than non-business infrastructure.

The frustrating thing is we have had no communication from the Communications people (COX)  One rep tells us one thing, another rep tells us something else.  One rep sent a tech out after I told her not to because I knew we had lines down.  He came anyway and it was a waste of his time. It would not be so frustrating if we had an estimate time.  Everyday coming home from work, well are we going to have TV or not?  Do we make plans to stay home or go watch the ballgame at a friends.  I have been patient long enough!!

It might help customers to know what is going on, rather than sitting on the phone for hours just to be told, you are aware of the problem. Also, when I test my internet through your website, why does it say that there is no problem detected? I think it says that to everyone. I have zero internet and zero information. That combination is a potentially disastrous one for you. I will not continue to support a company that doesn‚Äôt give a (bleep) about their customers. You seriously need to hire someone to manage the ‚Äúcustomer experience‚Äù.

5093493710	2020-10-01T23:24:57	disqus_H5wrjPTrvu	istheservicedown	My phone calls started dropping since yesterday. I was told to give it a few hours and it should return to normal. Well, I did that and it didn't work. I've had to use Google hangouts to make a phone call because my phone wouldn't make a call (not even 611.) If this doesn't get fixed, I want you to refund my money and I'll change providers. I had been satisfied with cricket, until you caused my calls to drop. Fix this issue because I need my phone for important calls. If not, refund my money.

I may go to att I don‚Äôt like being lied to at all to get me to pay more money I have medical issues and with seniors they play on that because we need our phones.

If they know there‚Äôs an issue why put you through jumping through the hoops of resetting networks going into setting turning off WiFi turning this off that off restarting the phone etc: it‚Äôs BS that we jump through hoops when all they need to say is I‚Äôm sorry Verizon is experiencing technical issues now I‚Äôm paying more and I have no better service

I have moved many times, and Spectrum is THE WORST cable provider I have ever seen. And it's never their fault- it's the weather, the phone company messing with their wires, or it's the customer's fault:  you need a new box, a new cable, a new doohinky, new remote, a new tv.......what we need is a new cable company because I have never seen any product break down as much as Spectrum.

Inscrutable Alert that looks like a hack states "Your email will be upgraded from Workspace to Microsoft 365 Email ...". Spent 1.5 hrs with tech on support chat (after a 30 min wait). Tech wasn't aware of the problem. Eventual answer was essentially "that's the way it is until the change happens on Nov 2". Got an email which contains the statement "There will be no interruptions to your service". I do not consider not being able to reply to an email "no change". There are so many things wrong with this - it disgusts me. I need someone else to host my Domain Name/Email.

I've lived in 5 different states with the same amount of ISPs and not one of them have been as incompetent as Mediacom. I have been without WiFi since August 10th. I wish I could say its because of the storm but I've lived in Florida. Over there hurricanes and bad weather happen regularly and I'm usually up and running again within a week. I was living in New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy and the power was out for entire 2 weeks but when it came back on so did the wifi right along with it. What's worse is that they keep lying to me about the dates that they'll be running again but every time that date just goes by. It has been almost 2 months and I'm utterly disgusted.

5099485902	2020-10-06T12:15:50	Old_Davy	istheservicedown	My current internet speed is .09 mpbs.  That's POINT ZERO NINE.  I can't get anything to load and I can't report it to Clink either.  Their phone system is "experiencing heavy call volume" and the only thing you can do over the phone is pay your bill.  You can't even speak to a customer representative.  The online chat bot is also down.  You'd think that with everyone working from home that Clink would be more responsive and transparent with their outages, but they don't tell us anything about what's happening.  When I try to check status of my service, I always get the same response that there are NO ISSUES anywhere.  BS!

EarthLink has been rejecting my login requests from GMAIL app on Android and on Outlook 2010 on PC, intermittently since yesterday afternoon -- now continuously.I connect via Verizon FIOS to Earthlink email.  Webmail seems to work.It is now 9:24 AM EST in Jersey City, NJI have been an Earthlink customer for more than 25 years.  Service was never great -- but it has been steadily deteriorating for last decade, going from tolerable to just plain terrible.  User interface on account maintenance websites is dreadful and doesn't even allow account updates.  Has anyone else noticed this decline or is it just me?

The internet hasn‚Äôt worked right since they installed it in September. Plus, we don‚Äôt even get some TV stations or cable channels. For some reason the info commercial and other stupid channels work fine. We have virtually no HD. Plus, we try to record shows and the recording is missing segments and broken picture. Then of course figuring out there packages is near impossible. They never gave me any printed materials, channel lists or setup instructions. Get crazy messages like ‚Äútry viewing this in your living room tv‚Äù. But, I‚Äôm laying for four rooms not one. It‚Äôs over priced and lousy performance. Plus, no straight answers. Nice telephone people but they don‚Äôt have the tools to answer accurately. I probably will cancel and go back to ATT or DirectTV.

5101415200	2020-10-07T19:07:52	daltonstockman	istheservicedown	Hi, curious about my package. Shipping number is 9405511899220266410530 USPS says accepted but tracking history says it is still pending. Been sitting in Longwood, FL Since Sept. 25.
5101419640	2020-10-07T19:11:03	garrick_larson	istheservicedown	Fargo, ND/Moorhead, MN area has had very poor cell coverage going back at least four months where we have 1-2 bars most of the time, rarely LTE. We have not seen a 4G signal since sometime in April. Calls dropped, choppy voice quality, calls can go out or come in at all, delay of text messages where 20+ will come through at one time, webpage take more the 7minutes to load. The experience has rendered my cellphone nearly useless unless I'm hooked to WiFi. So far in at least 2 service calls, T-Mobile has not been able to resolve or explain my problem. BTW, the problem is with all our family phones, all have been restored, turned off removed SIM card, reset carrier and wireless settings. I can't help but think it has something to do with the Sprint merger about the same time.

Website just says "pending" and I expect it will remain in that state forever.  Reached somebody at FedEx who "escalated" it, but all that person could do was read me the same information that was on the tracking website, which was completely useless.  Can't imaging ever shipping anything via FedEx ever again.

5101673156	2020-10-07T22:38:52	justinvoigtschild	istheservicedown	I am trying to install anti-virus at my parents house and have gotten a message multiple times that their laptop is not connected to the internet due to router or access point problem. Multiple error messages of this type popped up and had to use troubleshooter to keep installation going. Also it has been a horribly slow download speed when it was working during this time. You'd think paying $75 a month that they would have been prepared with a better, faster, more stable network for this pandemic with all the online learning and working from home? The quality of internet for what they're paying is a joke! Spend less $ on stock buybacks and executive bonuses and more on making your network what it should be.Justin...Onalaska, WI

At a neighbors using their Wi-Fi to write this while trying to find some resolution. Charging for a service you refuse to provide is criminal. Can't wait for my bill this month. So I can once again pay for a service I can only use 50% of the time. When everyone is sleeping. Fix the problems at 80449! Do your job that you charge for. Do your job!!!!

I am in the same boat as all these others. 4 packages arrive in Troutdale then it says they are in transit to Portland for a good 4-5 days which is ridiculous. One said due to weather for some reason, though we had blue skies and sun. 2 say they are on the truck for delivery now for well over 4 days. I had to call chewy.com as my dogs special dog food was late and they were almost out. Chewy is sending a replacement but within an hour of reporting it to chewy, suddenly fedex said the package was out for delivery and actually was delivered. Maybe I need to report these other packages to amazon since they were the shipper. Fedex was always the reliable one but I guess not anymore or at least for anything coming to Portland.

Unfortunately, the way the internet services and companies are allowed to operate currently means that many areas only have 1 or 2 services and even then those services may not reach every neighborhood or building.  It's something that will only be fixed with legislation forcing ISPs to operate outside of the oligopoly system they currently have (a few companies maintain a near-monopoly and keep new companies out of the game entirely).

5110657937	2020-10-15T01:01:46	None	istheservicedown	I'm in Boise Idaho now, where the service is utter garbage. At first I thought maybe it's cause I'm in the woods now but its not even woods like that. And honestly man it's not just me, after reading the comments here, i am sure of one thing, AT&T y'all seen the last of me.This was acting up before I got out here, i was in vegas, but it wasn't nearly as bad. For almost 3 years I've been using this service and it's been fine.All of a sudden like a few weeks ago I noticed it slowing down. Constantly stuck loading the page or video, yet for the ads, it loads and plays no problem. Without a hitch.Y'all got your priorities wrong.Within the past week the problem has skyrocket. I can't even load a song on YouTube, yet, you guessed it, it loads and plays the at before buffering on each and every video.Thanks for charging me 15 bucks more than you were supposed to last month as well. Like I was going to just not even mention that but, again your advertisers should be the ones on the hook. Not the common cat just tryna play some music or google some shit, or even know if someone's trying to call. Cause that's another thing, not that im the most popular cat, but there is a reason beyond internet i pay for this shit in the first place and it's to stay in touch with my people's.Peace.

Strangely, the problem is intermittent as I will occasionally get a signal for a few minutes.  But the vast majority of the time I can't get service.The problem lies with my nearby cell tower because my phone works fine once I leave this area and encounter a different cell tower.  I have contacted T-mobile on three occasions, but they continue to claim that their service is fine.  But they also admit that they "upgraded" their cell tower in my area about the same time my phone service stopped working.   Very frustrating  .  .  .  !
5111889140	2020-10-15T23:21:43	None	istheservicedown	My T-mobile cell phone service has been down for around 2 weeks.

The problem appears to lie with my local cell tower as if I drive out of this area for a few miles, I get normal service.  I have contacted T-mobile three times and they always claim that their service is fine.  But they also admit that they "upgraded" their cell tower about the same time that I lost service.  They simply refuse to deal with my problem.  It appears that I am going to have to find another service provider after having used T-mobile for seven years.  Why do they have such poor support?

5112186151	2020-10-16T05:25:05	None	istheservicedown	Seems like t mobile cant get their story straight on why we don't have signal. They say their service is fine but then most people don't have signal. I am unable to make any phone calls. Even emergency calls. My dad is also sick and both our phones don't work well. Better believe there will be a law suit if my phone is unable to get calls if my dad ends up in the hospital or dies. I pay for a service I am unable to use. This is crap. Luckily I have wifi or I wouldn't have any service at all. How can tmobile say there is no problem when their connection issue map is orange all across the United States? Tmobile get your act together!

5113486900	2020-10-17T04:31:17	None	istheservicedown	Louisville KY. I swear i think they lie about the speed that your suppose to be getting becuz i would do a speed test on my wifi or my landline an it'll tell me that I'm getting what I'm suppose to on the spectrum speed test but when I do a speed test that came built into my cell phone or my Xbox one I'll get a totally different number which would be way lower then what the spectrum speed test says. I'm getting real tired of not being able to watch a movie on Netflix or on my prime without it lagging really bad throughout the whole movie an now it's doing the same thing when i try an play my Xbox one and it's wired therefore it should not lag at all.  So what is it spectrum? Are you all getting people on again by telling them that they're getting the speed they're paying for and they're really not? And yes I did say again because this was done in New York before and they had a class action lawsuit over it. But That's the only thing I can even think of on why my Xbox one would be lagging with a wired connection and me getting different speed results from different apps other than spectrum speed test app. So WTH is  really going on? This has been an on going thing with this company for along time so I'm starting to think that it's about time to switch over to AT&T i guess. But then again there not much better that's why they both keep playing around with there customers because they both know that there's pretty much no one else to get your internet through that has high enough speeds especially if you're a gamer. I think that it's wrong and it should be corrected somehow. Get it together spectrum because Ive been a paying customer faithfully for about 6 years now an I've had just about enough with y'all's BS. I'm really about to the point of contacting me an attorney. And I'm not making any threats or anything like that I just want my stuff fixed. An i don't think that I'm asking to much especially when i do pay my bill every month an one time every month. I'm sick and tired of every time I go to play a game my internet wants to lag when I have 200 MBPS download speeds that I'm supposed to be getting that I pay for but then again can't play my damn xbox one or stream a movie from netflix or amazon prime. That does not sound like 200 MBPS to me especially if i have my Xbox 1 hard wired. An I'm not even going to start with the wifi speed I've been getting. No yeah IAM i should not be getting only  10 MBPS TO 20 MBPS an maybe 30 MBPS if I'm lucky when I'm paying $69.00 dollars a month for 200 MBPS of f-ing internet. I'm sick an tired of all the different excuses from you all i just want my internet to work that's all. If someone was to come along an opened another internet company where people can get speeds like what you are supposed to give but they actually delivered on it with decent prices that company would put you all an AT&T out of business I wish to God someone would step up it shouldn't be that hard. I'm sorry I'm just pissed of right now when we got our internet we pacifically told you guys that we were gamers and that it was very important that we got the speeds we paid for so therefore when I can't play my game because the internet is always messing up and I pay as much money as I do a month for what I'm supposed to get and I don't get it if you were me you would be pissed off too just fix it

5113492081	2020-10-17T04:40:50	None	istheservicedown	Louisville ky. To the  people on here i know my comment before this one was really long an I'm sorry I'm just really frustrated right now an I've been putting it off on posting anything but I've had enough an i just let it all out becuz I'm so tired of it. If i pay for a service i expect that service to at least work more than not especially with how expensive that service is. Even though my last post may be long it's still worth y'all reading it. Hope everything starts to work out for whatever problems u guys an girls are having.
5113494737	2020-10-17T04:45:40	None	istheservicedown	Louisville KY.  LMAO.. i just realized at the top of this page where it says no problems detected at spectrum at this time  I wonder if spectrum is smart enough to think that maybe it's because someone's internet's messed up and they can't report a problem. SMH
5113505395	2020-10-17T05:05:49	None	istheservicedown	Hi sorry but I'm not from NE I'm from Louisville KY. But I'm still going to tell you that The frustrations is only going to get worse I've been with spectrum ever since they were Time Warner and I've been having problems with my internet ever since it switched over to spectrum if there was another internet provider that can give me the internet speeds that I need to game at a decent price I would leave spectrum in a heartbeat. Even though half the time i don't get my full internet speeds i pay for most of the time it won't interfere with my gaming but here lately it has been interfering and it's been interfering a lot even to the point to where its interfering with something as simple as streaming netflix or amazon prime and I'm getting really frustrated about it. I don't know if anyone has ever told you but maybe you should probably let the cable go and get you a fire stick and just pay for Amazon prime or a different streaming company there's also free ones you can download an well and you'll get a lot more for a lot less with them than you would spectrum you would just have to keep the internet that's all. I just thought I'd share that with you maybe you can look it up or look into it more or something becuz allot of people has done this becuz not only does/has spectrum been giveing people crappy service anymore they also want to keep going up on there prices for there services they seem to not have any respect for there long term customers they would rather give deals to new people only. I hope this can an will help you out some becuz now days we need to help one another out especially if we know away too help another to try an save money.

That can't be a excuse anymore,  these problems were well known years ago, first it was  ipv4 protocal was known to be a issue years ago running out of IP's , the equipment on your end is a complete mess for years and yiu are building upon a broken foundation and what you give us, excuse me,  rather what we rent (modem/router etc. )  is absolutely garbage,  you make it impossible to help ourselves & we can't  update our modem/router firmware  for better  performance  & results or adding a vpn is never compatible ,  forget buying a 3rd party set up as its not compatible with your network 90% of the time ,SO  its just time to do better as a company. I was climbing polls back in the day and am well aware how you guys work and im in cybersecurity now. I need my  up time . If we are "stuck" with your sub par service  via the area we reside in and this is the quality we can expect along with horrible customer service which now consists of live chat? Come on....its comedic. What' s more frustrating is you are quick take that money , as I pay early every month and like clock work 3 days later I'm getting a email reminder about next month's bill . I get it,  you are the monopoly at least in my area , but there are many other options popping up,  hell there are unlimited hotspot devices  at this point that are reliable and perform better , with double the fastest speed you offer now, even a cell carrier Hotspot or tether is a viable option. IT'S TIME TO DO BETTER ! ,To everyone else, I apologize,  please excuse my bitching , this is just nonsense,  we all pay good money to a company that could care less because they know most people are stuck or won't leave them . I will not be one of those people . Step up spectrum!

If I go outside and reboot, sometimes it works. No service on weekends last 2 weeks. Customer service first said they were working on towers, then said I probably needed a new sims card. I have had AT&T cell and landline for over 15 years because they were the only company that serviced my area at the time. Their service has always been substandard with constant outages on both phone systems.
5116358028	2020-10-19T16:05:46	dalehiroakiinouejr	istheservicedown	I am confuse on why my item was sent to the Washington DC Network Distribution Center after all this time being found at the Little Rock AR Distribution Center Annex.  Here is the track number 9400108205496704642267.This was shipped out to me on September 19, 2020 and hasn't had the update change from "in transit, arriving late" since September 23, 2020. On October 19,2020 it updated with stating that it has arrived at the USPS Regional Facility in Washington DC. This was supposed to come from Arizona to California.  Why of all sudden does it need to be sent to the wrong direction? Why did it go from Arizona to Washington DC then heading off to Arizona to California instead? This is a first for packages or items with tracking ended up like this.Thank you for all the help and helping me understand why this happens.

5116503634	2020-10-19T17:51:04	disqus_qx4JaJERHC	istheservicedown	Thanks Max.  It seems there's lots of trouble at Pitney Bowes.  But it said it completed unloading at Des Moines, which isn't something I've seen before.  Overall, this is probably a bottleneck problem--lots of packages and not enough people power to keep things moving.

5116521451	2020-10-19T18:04:07	disqus_7diInyRzE4	istheservicedown	Down in New Phila, OH AGAIN. Spectrum, this trend you have going with the constant outages is absolutely ridiculous. Sub par service (and that's putting it nicely!) for top dollar?!Every month I actually count on at least 6-10 times that I won't be able to use my service. When checking in to see the status of service, Spectrum states that there's no current problems, which is obviously false. This company is unreliable, over priced, and I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

You just want our money.  I'm so tired of crappy  gold TV and not being able to watch it.  And then when it is on, the channels are all fuzzy.  All I get is no signal and this little circle that keeps going around, or a slide of New York and all there lights, this is what I pay for.  And then if you want to talk to a real person to get it fixed, you play hell trying to get someone.  You waste your battery on your phone WAITING.

And they truly don't make an effort to fix the constant issues that continue to cause the fails on a regular basis.  You can't get them to even consider a break on the bill - that would mean an acknowledgement that their service is not all it's cracked up to be.  You can't refuse to pay a bill; they will disconnect your service.   Thanks for nothing Spectrum.

5119104130	2020-10-21T15:48:55	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Catherine hopefully it was accepted and may be at the next facility just not scanned as arrivedSometimes it's the shipper to us and not us  Pitney Bowes and DHL E COMMERCE are the worst! Please give it a few days more and if no movement then please contact consumer affairsor have the sender go down to the post office they dropped the package off and talk to a supervisor or the postmaster thereMax
5119109907	2020-10-21T15:53:13	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	I see it's been in Newark NJ since October 8thYou already made a complaint and your post office should be able to contact them by emailpreferably the postmaster  Please don't talk to any window clerks just the postmaster about thisHe or she should have some contact information about this facilityMax

We pay Comcast three times as much as do Western Europeans for this excuse for ‚Äúservice‚Äù, yet our ‚Äúservice‚Äù is inferior.Such gross neglect is motivated solely by the corrupt policy of governance accountable only to greed. Both the legislators who do not criminalize this neglect and those who pay themselves hundreds of millions for stealing from their clients should be in prison.

5119146366	2020-10-21T16:20:26	spdevere	istheservicedown	Hi, i have a package that has been "in transit, arriving late" since the 13th of October and it hasn't updated since the 16th. I'm not sure what to do or where my package is. I contacted USPS and they basically said just wait, as if there is nothing they can do.9400111298286828798557I have seen suggest that people contact consumer affairs but I am unsure how that will help me or if you're just suggesting to write a review/comment?Any help is much appreciated!
5119181070	2020-10-21T16:45:20	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	I see here it arrived at Nashville TN Distribution Center Annex on Oct.12thNo departure scan from there  Hopefully it wasn't damaged!I would recommend waiting a few more days and if no movement please contact consumer affairs and request a package search or file a claimand by the way it's not in transit as it's still thereMax
5119189078	2020-10-21T16:51:09	spdevere	istheservicedown	Wow, I guess in transit on their website must mean that it hasn't been delivered or declared by an employee to be unmovable for some reason (destroyed etc).Thanks!

5119298932	2020-10-21T18:08:21	countermeasures1	istheservicedown	Max, do you represent the US Post office? I used to work at the 2nd. largest PO distribution point on the North East Coast - before computers. We never had this kind of a "failure to repair" - even at Christmas. It's all about leadership - WHICH CERTAINLY IS LACKING AT THE PO GENERAL LEVEL. The word I get from the local guys is that the general situation is quickly deteriorating into a disaster. I'm surprised the IRS service center served by Charlotte isn't screaming. We all empathize with shortages, COVID (wear your mask), no overtime, machine downtime, weather, etc. BUT - whatever happened to: "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" - except POLITICS.

5121464154	2020-10-23T05:56:05	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	I see it's been at Jersey City since the 14th of October no departure scan from there Seems like Jersey City is always backed up and they may not be working the mail by the oldest date first.  They may be working the mail at random  and your package is not in transit if it's still there! all packages that get processed on machines are automatically scanned as in transit even though it didn't leave the facility.  All you can do now is wait a few more days and if no movement by Monday then please file a claim or contact consumer affairs not your local post office and request a package searchMax

So, they promised they would never throttle back or block other web service providers, streaming services like Netflix, or business websites, etc;, as soon as the December 2018 ruling happened, and they were given power over the internet, AT&T was first caught slowing down or throttling back their competition, during the California Fires, Verizon purposely slowed one of the FireFighter's Station's Internet (which could have cost people their homes or worse, their lives! - These are Facts and they have been caught purposely slowing down Netflix.  Look it up. I keep telling people to demand your congressional "representatives and Senators" to re-instate Net Neutrality, but since most all of them from both sides of the fence received hundreds of thousands to millions in "campaign funds"; they are not doing anything about it. Wonder how many hospitals are shut down right now due to either incompetence on one of the carriers' or worse, they are purposely slowing down to stopping the service to say, "Just like the mafia would" - "If you want faster service, We have a new package available for a certain fee, of course!".

5121786043	2020-10-23T13:41:51	None	istheservicedown	I have had at least 7 tech persons come to my home for various issue starting in July 2020.  I have had to work late several times to catch up, because during the day especially around 11:30 - 1:00 pm the internet  is having connectivity issues?  I have had the most problems with their service in the past few months than I have had in a lifetime combined.  So "freaking" frustrating.  If they are having problems, or updating their infrastructure....hey reach just out to a customer and help them understand.  Is is normal for a person to have to reset their Modem 5 times in a day.  At least 10 times or more during a given week?  You call customer service for technical help and you could BARELY understand what they are saying, reps they hire in foreign countries.  Heck American's need jobs too!  [That's another story]  They tell you to do what you did already, you know the ropes because you have been thru it several times.  HELL, I know my password my heart.  The bottom line these internet providers need to let people know what's going on, why are we having so many problems with the internet.  I am quite sure they are overwhelmed with more people working and schooling remotely more than ever.  I am at my wits end.
