5123115875	2020-10-24T14:30:39	None	istheservicedown	I dropped my bills at the Springfield PO on Monday morning. On Sat my credit card company informs me my payment hasn't arrived and I'll be charged late fees and interest. Thanks. For years my check arrives in 3 - 4 days. This time it won't make it for at least 7 days. You may say that's within reasonable timeframe, but it's not reasonable if it's suddenly, without warning, taking almost twice as long. Sucks!

Do you not provide SLOW wifi/internet service on purpose because a HIGH percentage of customers will naturally call to request an upgrade & have to spend more money because Ziply & other service providers know how important our internet is to us so it's in their favor to slow down our WiFi speed. IT SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW

You can connect to a local area network via WiFi but not be able to connect to the Internet. Xfinity is not your "WiFi" service -- the router with built-in WAP provides the WiFi signal. People think "WiFi" and "Internet" are the same thing. Argh.

Your device can connect to a WiFi signal just fine, without one being connected out to the Internet."WiFi" is not synonymous with "Internet" -- not the same thing at all. You connect to your local area network via WiFi, and your local area network connects out to the Internet.

5131722381	2020-10-31T00:48:05	disqus_jBWn1Rx0f4	istheservicedown	Hi Max,Thank you for your time for helping out people. My tracking number is 92071969009997901314139286. It was mailed on October 23rd and arrived at harrisburg distribution center on october 25th and departed from harrisburg distribution center on October 26. Since then it is sitting in the status of 'Transit to next facility'. When I tried to reach out to my local post office (Mechanicsburg) the manager over there said that the package is stuck on one of the trucks and she will be mailing the harrisburg center to move it asap. Still there is no change in the status. I am worried if the package has been lost as it contains my security deposit refund check. Can you please check and let me know how long it is going to take to get delivered if it is not lost? If it is really stuck in the truck will it ever find its way to the destination or will it be lost eventually? Thanks in advance for your help.

5131738125	2020-10-31T01:05:49	None	istheservicedown	Still waiting for internet service to be restored in the 30152 area. The automated message initially indicated that the service would be restored at 6:02 PM on Thursday!!! Going on almost 48 hours and no text and no tech in sight. If I didn’t pay my bill you would have no problem cutting off service. I want to see a credit on my bill. I’m not paying for this HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! They are a monopoly in your his area, and, therefore, they are getting away with this lousy service. We need more competition, so we can kick them where the sun doesn’t shine when they treat us like this!!!!
5131739138	2020-10-31T01:06:57	disqus_jBWn1Rx0f4	istheservicedown	Hi Max,Thank you for your time for helping out people. My tracking number is 92071969009997901314139286. It was mailed on October 23rd and arrived at harrisburg distribution center on october 25th and departed from harrisburg distribution center on October 26. Since then it is sitting in the status of 'Transit to next facility'. When I tried to reach out to my local post office (Mechanicsburg) the manager over there said that the package is stuck on one of the trucks and she will be mailing the harrisburg center to move it asap. Still there is no change in the status. I am worried if the package has been lost as it contains my security deposit refund check. Can you please check and let me know how long it is going to take to get delivered if it is not lost? If it is really stuck in the truck will it ever find its way to the destination or will it be lost eventually? Thanks in advance for your help.

5131770180	2020-10-31T01:44:48	disqus_QgWGsxpq6c	istheservicedown	Hi, I'm not Max but Max did talk me down from a panic earlier this week, for which I am truly thankful!  I know for sure the entire postal office system is overwhelmed at the moment....the 'in transit' status can mean it is sitting in a sorting office and the office is just so crammed they haven't scanned it yet....don't panic!  My documents were stuck 'in transit' in Philadelphia from Oct 22nd to Oct 30th....and then in the space of 3 hours today it went from 'arrived at faciltiy' to 'delivered'. Mine was supposed to show up on Monday and got delivered on Friday so I'd say you will likely see it move in another couple of days.  Good luck!

Or to find out if they are at least my area working on the issue. But when I called Comcast back and pretend I was calling for new service a Rep. came on the phone very quickly and research for me and gave me an estimate time of service  restored in my area next by Friday November 6th!

Xfinity isn't giving any information on restore times,  other than to say it'll be as soon as possible.  Others in my area had service restored as soon as their power came back.

5132162703	2020-10-31T13:04:08	None	istheservicedown	No offense, but there are a lot of people without power. The linemen are working overtime away from their families to fix the problems that you’re having. They have to sleep, eat, and take breaks... it’s not laziness. They just aren’t super humans. The amount of people without electricity far outweighs the amount of crew members available to help fix the problem.

Can’t get to a live human when calling them. The message says your service is out (duh) and they have a good day and disconnects you.  No update on the app or site.   Should have stayed with ATT.  The lines are underground!
5132188902	2020-10-31T13:32:15	None	istheservicedown	We are entirely to dependent on Xfinity for the service to be down this long with no communication.  This is absolutely ridiculous. Even though I will never get service from AT&T again, Xfinity nerds to stop the commercials about AT&T because they are no better.
5132190817	2020-10-31T13:34:14	None	istheservicedown	AT&T probably cut Xfinity's lines
5132197382	2020-10-31T13:41:01	None	istheservicedown	I do understand that. What I don’t understand is not receiving any type of information from a company that literally millions rely on? I too have to sleep, eat, and work for a living but I currently cannot do that because I have no power when it’s 60 and sunny out from 1 minute since the tiny storm went through. They have workers, just not ones who want to work. The job shouldn’t take that long
5132197715	2020-10-31T13:41:20	None	istheservicedown	Internet has been out since 10/28/20 @ 10pm. Spectrum is non-existent.

I'm really upset with this because some of my neighbors have service and like me some don't.  At first I was given a appointment for the 4th of November for a tech and then it was cancel stating it was a outage.

The call and text updates on retoration of service have been "as soon as possible" since 2:25 on Thursday. This is insane. It's one thing to take a while to restore service, but it's ludicrous to communicate so poorly with your customers. My household works from home and have digital school. We've had to go to friends' houses for wifi.
5132248850	2020-10-31T14:32:20	MonanLu	istheservicedown	At this point, we need a class action suit to break up the ATT and xfinity monopoly in our areas. There is 0 competition!! We need reimbursement not just for loss of service but the business we have missed.

5132491228	2020-10-31T18:04:48	nikkisheffield	istheservicedown	Seriously frustrated. Two months in a row that a storm comes through knocks out power and internet. Power company can get the power restored in a reasonable amount of time, but the second time in two months that we are 5 days without internet. Comcast won’t credit our bill for it either. I feel for people that depend on it to do their job remotely from home. Ridiculous.

Unprofessional, unreliable, unacceptable. All prescribers need to relay their dissatisfaction, as I am sure our next bill will not reflect the amount of time we did not have service. To say it nicely. This pisses me off.

5133299058	2020-11-01T12:42:00	disqus_b5QHUexoxw	istheservicedown	As someone who gets an outage every slightest whisper of rain, my tip for getting your bill credited is, unfortunately, to keep calling and find an agent that's helpful. For some reason, some flat out refuse and claim they can't help you, and others can do it in seconds. Now, that means calling comcast is pretty much a hobby for me at this point, but maybe just try calling again if you haven't already done it twice?
5133302001	2020-11-01T12:45:43	None	istheservicedown	We are fed up. Both my husband and I work from home and need the internet!! Unbelievable!! We called and finally spoke to a human and he said he had no idea when it would be fixed! He also said that if it's down for 3 days you get half off your bill and 4 days, a full month!! Probably have to go through hoops to get that. To me that's not the point, the service is really pathetic.

I pay over 200 a month for your Internet and TV service, as a ex firefighter I tell people that unless you register your phone number with the 911 dispatch center they have no idea where you might be calling from, and if you get a regular phone service it will automatically come up.

5134216984	2020-11-02T03:53:46	None	istheservicedown	I think the worst part about all this is that I am a teacher and have been asked to constantly monitor our students’ virtual progress, but I can do no such thing without internet. I lost it last Tuesday, and our school district is having to designate some of this week as inclement weather days because teachers and students ALL do not have internet. I have seen 1, again just 1, Cox communication truck but dozens of OG&E crews out in the streets. How has my power been on all week but I still have no estimated time for my internet to be on?

5134352335	2020-11-02T08:17:20	cierrezimmerman	istheservicedown	Been without internet since Thursday despite the fact that my power was never actually out. Called out of work on Thursday and have had to make the 45 minute drive up 85 on Friday, Saturday, and now Monday to work in the office during a pandemic. The Xfinity app shows there’s “no issues directed” at my address but when you look on the actual map it says there’s an outage in my zip code (30340) literally right on the Main Street that my apartment complex is adjacent to effecting 2500+ people. I’ve seen hundreds of tweets and FB posts frompeople either in my zip code or in the neighboring towns all stating they’re expediting outages so clearly it’s not just me despite customer service reps trying to claim it’s an issue with my equipment. However since I own my own modem/router instead of paying them every month it’s going to be a $70 charge for a tech to come out but they can’t even make it out for 3-5 days. I’m pissed.

I currently have 3 there. They aren’t hard to miss: they’re bright orange! Are they marked as the red-headed step-child and shoved in a corner somewhere? I pay a LOT in shipping for those when so many other places have free shipping arriving within a few days. Shutterfly has sometimes refunded my shipping but it really doesn’t appear to be their issue. Why are these always stuck? Seems sketchy.

On a trip visiting my parents and you guys took 8 hours so far of my very limited time with them because they needed help fixing their internet. Guess I'll wait on hold for 2 hours tomorrow so I can threaten legal action, this neighborhood has a very strong case for a malpractice suit.

Do the post office workers steal.?.?I don’t see how it could be lost. And if it’s damaged that should say so. All the postmaster can tell me is it left the office to a sorting I’m assuming someone can call the sorting facility.

5136533347	2020-11-03T20:06:14	None	istheservicedown	Windstream has always been a terrible company to us, and in general. The bundles they offer are primitive, the amount of times our MBPS fluctuated like crazy without remaining stable. The countless times I called technicians over to help with problems just for them to reset the modem and say “Yup, it’s fixed.” This company is ridiculous and just a shame in comparison to other competitors. Having Windstream internet is the equivalent to talking through a tin can attached to a string. I’ve had the internet down for two days now, I’ve called so many times to get an estimation on the regard. Then when the time actually reaches, nothings changed. I then call again, and the cycle repeats. I get another estimated wait time, and another, then another, and another. They play their customers like lab rats and show sense of real aid. I’ve never once been happy or satisfied with the company. Nor will I ever. I’m forced to pair with Windstream due to them being the only internet provider in my area. Although Comcast is five miles down the road, and I can’t reach that. Just pathetic.

Cox support said my modem was bad and to call Arris. I told the cox rep it was a signal issue and not my modem. A day later, we went back on the outage list. Neighbors have been told between November 12 - 15 before Cox services is restored. Cox is using generators in other areas as a workaround until service is back up. Cox isn't do that for my area. My wife and I both work from home and I attend online classes. Can't do either without internet. We tried using our mobile hotspot, but due to the cellular traffic, its way too slow. I'm shocked that Cox doesn't have some type of disaster recovery plan for these situations. I guess blaming the electric companies is their disaster recovery plan.

This is getting very frustrating and tiresome. For as much as it costs one would think they could keep the system up and running! Two days in a row would be amazing!!

5138476949	2020-11-05T03:00:15	disqus_e0B4nBxsJA	istheservicedown	Over the last 6 months Spectrum RoadRunner has gotten extremely unreliable. My Spectrum cable TV almost never goes out. But, my Spectrum RoadRunner cable broad band goes out every week. Today it was down for over 3.5 hours. Hard to believe I'm paying Spectrum almost $60.00 a month for this crap service. I will switch to SpaceX Starlink  as soon as it becomes available. I'm in S.E. Wisconsin.

Worst service I have ever dealt with. Dumping them when my contract is up.
