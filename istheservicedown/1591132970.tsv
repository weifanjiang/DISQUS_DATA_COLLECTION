Does anyone know what the issue is?? Was there an accident did lighting hit...what is causing this outage and does anyone have an ETA on when it will be restored?  I already did not like Suddenlink and now I am an even more unsatisfied customer,  If they could just tell us what the issue is and some sort of ETA so we could plan accordingly that would be better than the NOTHING we are receiving.

Maybe it's time for a class action suit. Any lawyers out their interested? Seems to me that selling new contracts without giving promised service is fraud. All of them promise higher speeds than they can consistently deliver, but constant outages because of faulty infrastructure should not be tolerated. Whatever happened to all that money that we taxpayers gave them via our government for infrastructure improvements in rural areas?

We rebooted our system thinking there may have been an interruption due to the heavy rain storms sweeping through Tampa area, but that didn't help.

Hope your techs can isolate and troubleshoot the problem and get it fixed.

I need the internet for my job  as a gig worker through a few different apps and when this extremely ANNOYING, FRUSTRATIING, and INFURIATING problem happens it is interfering with me trying to make a living.  Verizon is blaming the town of Port Orange and their alleged resistance to building/installing new towers.  I'm gonna aim my anger at both sides here.  Get your sh@! in order you aholes, there are a lot of people in the area and a lot of businesses and workers depend on strong, consistent internet connectivity to do their jobs and make a living.

4943396774	2020-06-06T15:22:42	zitab	istheservicedown	UPS package was supposed to be delivered on 5/19. Still waiting. Still receiving messages that it's delayed.At one point it was going to be sent to a place for me to pick it up. That didn't happen. Then there was a lie about a delivery attempt; saying 'customer not home' ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Everyone is HOME!! Have not a seen a UPS truck in my neighborhood FOR WEEKS and can't get any answers. I KNOW that it's insane right now and I'm really trying to be patient but this is a pretty extraordinary delay. It'd be great if they didn't lie about what is happening.

4943575542	2020-06-06T17:57:34	lysagatis	istheservicedown	I tried to sign up for Informed Delivery online 6/4/20 but couldn't get verified online. Because I'm with Republic Wireless their phone numbers can't be used for ID verification. (However, that same phone number was verified by USPS for text message use for any future need for account recovery.) So the next option was to go to the PO for in-person ID verification with drivers license and/or voter registration card and a bar code USPS gives you when you start the Informed Delivery process online. I've gone to the PO 6/5/20 and 6/6/20 but was told the first time the server was down--so come back later. The next time I went I was told that the server--or whatever is used for the bar code scanning process--is down for COVID-19! Is it going to be possible to sign up for Informed Delivery any time soon?

4943692262	2020-06-06T19:45:46	disqus_XKl3isXOtP	istheservicedown	LOL, yeah.....I see they finally were scanned in Madison....literally 5 minutes after I dropped the re-shipments of those packages off in Gurnee (which would have came to you guys in Palatine because I wanted to avoid Oak Creek again on the reshipments). Luckily, I know them at Gurnee and they were able to take my packages out so I could pick them up. Yeah, Oak Creek obviously gave me wrong info. I actually physically went to Oak Creek at like 1am and luckily a supervisor was awesome and talked to me...she was the one who said they had delayed TUES/WED and sent all Pleasant Prairie mail to Palatine. Obviously they didn't know what was going on. I could tell by talking to the supervisor they are ridiculously short staffed and stressed up there....80 hour weeks. It worked out, though....you guys all do a great job....I know it's been difficult lately with staff and room shortages. We have shipped with you guys daily for 19 years and I never have issues...this was just a fluke.

4944059423	2020-06-07T02:24:44	northwest_writer	istheservicedown	Beware that Verizon signs you up with a attractive high data package and then voids it by intentionally claiming that your autopay couldn't go through. They then only allow you back with a lower data package at the same price. This has happened to me twice, my neighbor, and now my physically disabled client. I made sure (we have screenshots) that my client's autopay was enrolled and accepted and sure enough, his phone got cut off with no warning and they claimed he never set up autopay and wasn't going to be allowed the same plan. We have screenshots as proof. Verizon should be sued. That is worse than bait and switch, that is fraud.

To save time checking the sites of postal companies manually, I created "Parcels" website and mobile apps which will automatically check every relevant postal, courier and logistics company website on your behalf.  To find out where your parcel is, you need to know only tracking number of your package.What is a tracking number?Tracking number or tracking code is a unique number assigned to each package, which allows you to monitor the movement of the parcel between the countries or even inside one country. Tracking numbers can be international or traceable only within the country of the sender.  The tracking number in the format of the Universal Postal Union looks like RA123456789CN, where the first 2 letters are the type of package and the last 2 letters are the code of the country of origin. Packages with such numbers can be tracked right until delivery. Other shipments can be delivered by courier, transport and logistics companies, and how tracking codes look can vary a lot: CTAFT0000160477YQ, UPAAB000000251682107, AEL10105033654UA, SGADN143797855. Such packages are not always trackable in the recipient's country, and you'll have to wait for notification from the Post Office or a call from a courier company.Tracking eBay ordereBay sellers use multiple delivery and postal companies depending on item price and selected shipping method. Whether it's SpeedPAK, Pitney Bowes, Global Shipping Program, China Post, Winit, Yanwen or any other shipping company we've got your back. Read our extensive guide to tracking eBay orders.Delivery timeWondering how long it will take for your order to arrive to United States, UK, Canada, Australia or any other country? Wonder no more, with our state of the art delivery time estimation algorithm you'll always informed when to expect your parcel. We collect extensive delivery time statistics for each package going into each country and city and will use all of this data to get you most accurate estimated date of arrival.Download Parcels app for iPhone or Android to always know where your packages are, and get Push notifications when package tracking changes.

I was told the package was damaged, but FEDEX OAKPARK, MI --  location,  conveniently could not send a photo of the "damaged" package to the shipper, which is a requirement. I never got reimbursed for the shipping or the package. I am out $500.00.  Had I known these two packages were FEDEX, I would never have bought them from this seller.

The shipper has some form answer excusing FedEx about protests causing an issue (which we all know who live here, they have been peaceful.) So nobody will help and nobody knows a thing.

The shipper does not want to do that, they are excusing FedEx due to civil unrest. It doesn't add up for me. The protests here have been peaceful, there is not a huge local disruption, all other shipping companies are doing Ok through this time. My package is also furniture. Maybe we're getting this treatment due to the size and weight. When overwhelmed, skip the big ones?

I'm leaving Boost-shitt-Sprint-crap service forever. The customer service reps, if you can call them that, treat me like I am a complete moron. I build computer systems for not only the US Navy, but Lockheed, Raytheon, NASA and the JPL. Think again overseas idiots. My internet speed on my phone was tested at fast.com with local servers, many times. The fastest I got was 190 kbps. That's 2 56k dial up modems. So I called them. Ask for a supervisor. High call volume, no supervisors. Have one call me back OK? That never happened.   Oh. Did I tell you they told me I needed a new phone, that's why my phone internet is so slow. OK. Bought a new phone, deja Vu all over again. So I am leaving Boost-shitt-Sprint-crap service forever. Bye. Bye. Bye.

4948194841	2020-06-10T08:32:10	robert_walter	istheservicedown	Hi Max,I decided to take a few days to see if maybe things might start to move again before filing a claim. What is the situation at ISC?  Is it still a mess or better or getting normal, etc?I called the number you gave in our  first discussion here. That number was answered by CBP. The guy who answered was friendly and helpful. As I understood it he said the pkg was xrayed but he had no more info. He gave me two numbers, first one was  to the exodus team. That number was a recording that said the team has a new number. The new number had a recording giving an email address Because they are so busy.  Calling new number during business hours just gets the recording. The second number I think was to Usps but never was answered. I don’t have the numbers with me now but if you want them pls  let me know. Are you a Le to see anything new in my long waiting pkgs in isc and jfk?Thanks, rw

Looks like this outage involves multiple cities, hope things are solved soon.  I must say, however, that I have had WOW for more than five years and this is the first lengthy outage I have experienced.  There have been a couple of blips along the way but I could count those on one hand and they've always been really brief.  So I can ride this one out.  Heck, I used to have Spectrum (when it was Time Warner) and THAT would go out every single afternoon for 1-3 hours!  That's why I switched to WOW to begin with, couldn't be happier - though their communication on these outages could be a lot better & easier to find.

At first we thought it was our modem/router but no it's the internet. When you pay for a service you expect it to work reliably. Get it together Comcast and how about a cut in the cost if it's not going to work properly.

4951097360	2020-06-12T05:56:09	disqus_qFKIbRha3v	istheservicedown	I was able to report it missing at USPS.com tonight and within 10 min I received the tracking update. I find it suspicious that every single mail or package item I’ve sent to my mother (Southfield, MI) in the last month has been delayed nearly 2 weeks. It’s not just me sending from the Chicago area, her sister (sending from South Carolina), and a cousin (sending from Arkansas) are also seeing delays of 2 weeks regardless of our paying for a service that includes tracking. You are a prize @disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5:disqus for your replies and advice here. I’m glad I found this website and thank you so much. I’ll report when mom receives the package, I hope it’s soon. Frankly, I’m hesitant to order anything for her that ships USPS at this point, yet I want to support and use USPS.

4951200349	2020-06-12T09:19:10	robert_walter	istheservicedown	Hi Max, I sent an email after your last answer two days ago and while I haven’t heard back, I again tried the number the CBP guy gave me for the Usps customer care IST at ORD 773-894-9010. I was lucky as somebody answered this time!! (usually the call rang a number of times then transferred somewhere else and disconnected after a couple of rings.)The person checked both numbers and looked at the pics taken by the automated sorting equipment and said both packages, the labels and the bar codes looked fine (we together confirmed my receiving address was correct.)The info in the system indicated at both places that the packages were in the containers. Her opinion is that due to limited flights out of the USA, and the general chaos due to covid the containers are queued and waiting their turn for transport. So it looks like I just have to be patient as the system works thru the backlog. This is fine now that I know things are ok but just waiting their turn. Thanks for all your help!  RW.

Hopefully this pandemic will cease and everything will be back to normal I am always here for everyone and i do this mostly at home on my free time because i care for every single customer i keep in contact with!without customers like you i wouldn't have a job!Thanks again!Max

4953065859	2020-06-13T21:09:41	disqus_htIUK0W27A	istheservicedown	Max, how long should someone wait until they file a claim? My tracking number says "Expected Delivery by Saturday June 13th 2020, by 8pm". (That's today). June 11th it said "Arrived at USPS Regional Origin Facility INDIANAPOLIS IN DISTRIBUTION CENTER ANNEX". June 13th (today) it says "In Transit, Arriving Late. Your package will arrive later than expected, but is still on its way. It is currently in transit to the next facility." How is it supposed to get here by 8pm if the tracking history never shows it arriving in a distribution center in ATL?  This tracking info is giving me conflicting information if its saying expected delivery is "by 8pm" tonight but its "arriving late". 9405508205497824428123

However, I'm beginning to rethink my decision about choosing Verizon, as it clearly isn't above its competitors since it is being so greatly affected by (insert explanation for mysterious nation-wide cell service outage).I would like an explanation of the problem. Without one, I am going to assume Verizon is just an overpriced sham, no greater than their competitors affect by (insert explanation for mysterious nation-wide cell service outage), and take my business elsewhere. NO MORE RIPPING THIS CONSUMER OFF!

They told me that there is a System Update taking place and that is cause of all the problem.  My Question!  Why a system update with No Warning to their customers on a Monday???   This should be against The FCC Laws.  Many of us use these phones for our business.  The company only displays on the website that their engineers are working on the problem but offers no periodic updates.  Calling Customer Service is next to useless!!!!

I said this has been going on all day and that many customers use their phones in their business including myself.. He said "I am sorry".  Why would they do a system update on a Monday with no advance warning to their customers??? This should be against the FCC Laws.  They offer no periodic updates on their website either.  I am uncertain as to if this is only isolated to Metro PCS and the T Mobile Network or if other Networks are experiencing the same issues.  Of course, there is no information about this!

No information on your website as to what has caused/is causing this extremely severe outage that has lasted for far too long now (other than your engineers are aware and working on resolving the problem).   Considering that you are supposed to be a 'communications' company, you are failing dismally in this area.What the HELL is going on??  And, how are you proposing to compensate your customers for the MAJOR inconvenience they're experiencing (I'm understating the circumstances here) and, in many cases, grave loss of income.Please advise..

Times have changed and spoiled us. We come to depend on that powerful computer that we hold dear to us. It all comes down to this. There could be a day when nothing will work. Solar-flares for one, could wipe out the worlds power grid and leave us without power for months. Then what would we do. Some have the skills to survive while others never spent a day out in the wild. So take this as a test. and never get to conferrable with that powerful computer you hold in your hand.

I'm so close to asking for a refund because I bought this thing months ago and there's nothing the seller can do about it being lost in the mail.

For months, and no one seems to have any idea what's going on.The first tracking number is 4208260192748927005374000007811873The second tracking number is LY240507900CNSomeone PLEASE know something or give me any advice.

4956373897	2020-06-16T15:56:42	ilevaf45	istheservicedown	But for real though! Why isn’t that a policy? That when a company, such as Suddenlink, is providing a service, like the internet, is unable to provide the service for a reasonable amount of time (12-24hrs), charges for that time are not incurred upon the customer or they are credited for the time and inconveniences that the company has imposed, as a result of being unable to provide their services as advertised... sounds pretty damn good to me!

For the last 3 weeks we have intermittent service on internet and phone. The technicians have checked out everything and said it is a problem on line. I believe it because it goes off and on, off and on like a loose wire. However sometimes it is off for hours. Yesterday, my husband tried to report the problem, was told a 20 minute wait. After 45 minutes he was disconnected. And have you noticed Supervisors don’t exist. Oh, also, I was told there were 5 other houses  with the same problem. I am fed up and intend to file a consumer complaint with the FCC. You might want to do the same

It is definitely getting real these days.  Praise Jesus for paying the price so that we might all be saved!   Stand firm in your faith and keep pushing the enemy away.  We all struggle with one thing or another and its time to show the devil what power our Father has given us to be able to defeat him in the midst of battle.  Stay safe and may GOD keep each and everyone of you close until it is time to go home!

Do not bother with the drones at UPS they don't care. Pick up the phone and express your displeasure with the seller so they do not use UPS ever again!!!!

4958110878	2020-06-17T21:25:17	disqus_ZK94bvVA2W	istheservicedown	Hi there!(I'm not from this area, but this is where the shipping label for my package has been created, so I came here because I wasn't sure where else to inquire)I'm here because my package has been "on its way to a USPS facility" for 5 days. My package is coming from China, but I usually don't order from overseas, so I'm not sure if that's a normal duration of time to wait. I'm not too familiar with customs or how long that part of shipping takes. On the other hand, my local friends who have ordered from the same place haven't had situations like this. I filed a missing mail report because I was worried that I was getting scammed or that something was going wrong, but I'm unsure if that will work since I still don't really understand the situation. Would there be any explanation for any aspect of this? I can provide further details if needed.

Then they blamed the problem on snow, which was not true.  I don't know what today's problem is, but I know that I won't get any help from Direct TV.  They simply don't care.

Having lived in a number of states/communities, I have never, ever experienced anything like this.  Until the community demand better, we will continue to get this substandard service that leaves us vulnerable...no alarm systems, no phones...and perhaps no Internet for some.  This is the shear incompetence and it leaves all of us at the mercy of the "tower masters".  We need to demand to know what this is really about.  These are not typical outages.  What if there is a medical emergency for someone.  This has got to stop!!!

Found out at 9pm that phone service was out cell & landline and calling my landline, it bounced to Verizon roaming and hung up. At work this morning, we have WOW internet & phones but told our phone go through AT&T so we have no service but do have internet. You can't actually talk to anyone breathing so who knows. If you do get through, they speak English so poorly you can't understand them.

Sometimes it works right for a few hours, other times I can’t call or receive calls. Today I can’t text, or use any of my apps.

The half that are visible still can’t be accessed. Please hurry and fix these problems, I’ve always had decent experiences with T-Mobile (minus the high bill) I’d really hate to go to a different provider.

It shipped June 12th, it's June 18th, and it is somehow stuck "in transit to next facility." Give me a break! Filed 2 inquiry requests. One said it's due to Covid that we can't manage mail from 2 hours away basically. The 2nd response was, "sorry we have no idea where your shipment is." This isn't my first rodeo with usps. It's UPS for this guy for any delivery services here out. Thanks for all the extended frustration, trouble, and now a lost item claim that will likely take a month to receive a refund on.

4961289148	2020-06-20T10:49:24	andrewflinn	istheservicedown	As long as cable providers are allowed to have a virtual monopoly in a community, the consumers will always lose. The wiring/cabling is several decades old, at least 30 years old in my area, and while they claim it doesn't affect the signal, with every new splice, either for a new development, customer, or repair, it becomes that much more fragile. Without competition, there is no urgency to replace the infrastructure. Sure, Suddenlink is terrible, but that's due in large part for their terrible customer service.

The last time they told us that they needed to replace a node. called weeks later and they didn't know what i was talking about. this time the internet and tv have been cutting out occasionally. paying for 400 x 30 but have never been able to go past 200 down, can't drop the speed because of additional data charges. when I called technical support the first guy said that 10x8 was working, said it'd get better with time, and wouldn't create a ticket....which didn't sit right with me.I asked for a manager he said none were there....I called immediately back, the next guy told me that a manager was there and when I asked questions regarding the 10x8 getting better, he was confused and said only if their installing a new router. Whats going to happen when the middle school opens down the block?Can anybody look into replacing the node?

It switches between no more than 2 bars to No Service. Callers can’t hear when a call does go through, takes forever to get a call to go through, text messages and pictures will not send. The only way to operate the phone inside of any home or building is with WIFI calling. I have reported it to Verizon 6 times they refuse to acknowledge a problem and they have yet to fix it. Seems like it will never be fixed since no one wants to even admit that there is a problem. Looks like I have no choice but to switch carriers after 17years.

I got through to a tmobile rep via the messaging app and they said they are "modernizing" a tower in the area, but they haven't received any other complaints. Smh.

I work In Palatine Illinois and we are doing Pittsburgh and Detroit mail as we speak So a lot of the mail is re routed due to the facilities backed upMax
4965209135	2020-06-23T15:25:45	disqus_r5DRTdAhUc	istheservicedown	My package was expected to be delivered June 15th and never received. When I put in the tracking number it states that it was received June 13 in Memphis, TN and the last update states June 17th in transit to next facility. I have not had any other issues with all my other packages I have received. 9405528206335220541107Should I file a claim?

It is express so let’s hope they actually get it here this time, on time! Thanks again, Danielle

I literally just went through this last week, so I thought express, $80 it’s guaranteed they have to get it here! But of course not

4968035989	2020-06-25T17:10:14	None	istheservicedown	Hi Max,I sent a package out to California on June 15th. The status has been stuck in transit for over a week and usually packages I send over there stops in Fresno before getting delivered. Is there a delay there? Should I file a claim? Here’s my tracking #: 9505512467380167526585Thank you in advance!

4968059530	2020-06-25T17:27:31	None	istheservicedown	I’m in Henderson Nevada and I had a package out for delivery Friday.  The package wasn’t delivered and was marked that there was a natural disaster.  Same thing Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Along the way I had more packages fall in the hole.  I now have 4 packages out for fake delivery every day.  Amazon got me in touch with UPS who said they would put a priority on the deliveries and a supervisor would call me within an hour - no call and no packages.I’m mad as hell and wish I didn’t have to take it anymore!
4968062352	2020-06-25T17:29:37	daniarroyo73	istheservicedown	And as of right now who even knows where it is! I really can’t believe this, I read the USPS site and it said everything will be delayed, but express mail will continue to be delivered on time, guaranteed. There guarantee is worthless. I swear this is my last time with USPS. I don’t care what I have to pay UPS or Fedex. It was 80 with USPS express overnight. I’m sure UPS or Fedex would have not been much more!
4968063184	2020-06-25T17:30:13	None	istheservicedown	Package ordered Jun 16 with expedited delivery on Jun 19. Jun 19 FedEx said delivery delayed til Jun 22.  Now it's Jun 29.  Another package shipped in my home state hasn't arrived in over 1 week.

4968677587	2020-06-26T03:09:25	ashleypearse	istheservicedown	@Ask_Spectrum What in the world is going on?! I have been without internet service for the past 4 days, and I imagine many others have, too. This is impacting people’s jobs, their livelihoods; for some, this is their sole source of communication. This situation and the lack of communication around the progress of resolving this issue definitively is absurd and simply unacceptable.

I now had the same package try to be delivered 2 times. First 1 was trash because they took to long, so to make sure that didn’t happen again $80 for overnight express, and it still happened again. There was a big label on the front 1 day express, overnight. I can’t see how they missed it.

4969446458	2020-06-26T18:05:45	leiafong	istheservicedown	Here is generic conversation and or letter for your retailer(your vendor here) - Thank you for the update. However, I believe it is unreasonable for your carrier to tell you that due to their high volume of deliveries they have delayed my package for over ( your time period here) weeks . Please be aware that the same carrier in question has other packages for me from other retailers that I ordered (X number of weeks ago), they have all been delayed as well. Each showing arrival in my city and out for delivery EVERYDAY for the last (enter number here) weeks. I have contacted the retailers in each case and they have refunded my account due to the indefinitely delayed packages, I and the sellers believe they are "lost" and will never delivered to me or back to the respective retailers.As a result of my experience with your carrier, I find it completely reasonable to for you to refund my account. After all they are your carrier and you have my funds, so why should I be penalized for by your carrier. If you cannot resolve this in the next 2 business days, I will dispute the charge and have my bank declare fraud on the charge and have the monies returned to my account, as I have been charged for goods undelivered.I am happy to speak to your directly if you wish my number is (your number here) and Iook forward to your response.Regards,(your name here)

Interenet is constantly up and down at my house. Your customer service is trash. And the worst part of all is that nothing is done about it.

I hope this made sense and helps. If you do want to make your own call to ATT just be warned I was on hold for about 45min before I got someone. Best of luck. She did tell me that if you turn your wifi calling on I think it is you’ll be able to make calls over that and I have an iPhone my texts have been sending/receiving over WiFi with no issue.

4974302261	2020-06-30T16:45:38	None	istheservicedown	Their service, bandwidth, attitude, lack of knowledge is a horrible combo leaving the consumer in limbo and sucking up hours of time as we sit on hold or wait for a call back only to speak with someone who can't help and then are told from a script there is no problem in the system. WOW! It's been this way since signing on with them! And there is no recourse -- they do not compensate for OUR lost time dealing with them or having no or poor service. Constant issues. Unending problems. Obnoxious situations. Once in a great while maybe 10% of the customer support people or techs actually can help and it can take days or even weeks of calling and/or on site visits to get any resolution to a problem(s).

This is both sending and receiving, I have never had so many packages go missing in just a few weeks before, not everything was insured because I never thought they would screw up this badly. It doesn't matter if the package was large or small, or if it was an envelope, or shipped out different days. Are people just taking boxes of mail and just walking away with it? Packages that avoided Illinois ended up making it.

As of today  the last tracking update was  6/18 -      ” Your item is available for pickup by returns agent June 18,2020”.  I read that companies using the smart label for returns places your  return package to be held in bulk until someone gets it . So ,my question is who is responsible for the delay? The company or USPS? Thanks.

The one sent first, 15 April, routed thru Chicago is still AWOL. But the other sent 1 May and routed via JFK (and I suspect put in one of the sea shipments to Europe) arrived Today. So the patience has paid off and I expect that eventually the first pkg will eventually show up. Here’s the link to USPS info (at bottom) on diversions to sea freight. I had taken the worst case quoted timing, added all up and assumed the pkg might come on the 29th. I was short by 1 day. LoL. https://about.usps.com/newsroom/service-alerts/international/welcome.htmRegards. RW

Anything on your end? Or is Chicago still backed up? Or did they miss the scan? 9405509206094961834631Thanks Max!

I normally have packages go from New York Distribution Center to Spokane Distribution Center(I am in Washington State) but noticed a package was sent to Sacramento Distribution Center.

4975752714	2020-07-01T18:34:46	None	istheservicedown	FYI Max, When I called Pitney Bowes they basically can't help at all. They purchased another company that handles shipping, and that is why their name has become attached. But, all they can give you is the same tracking info that I received from my retailer. They told me that some facilities are backed up by at least a month so there is nothing that can be done but wait. I will say that I wish retailers would be more up front about the delays we might experience. This particular package was time sensitive and while I allowed a three week window for it to arrive (which it is now past), if I had known about how extensive the delay was I would have gone a different route. But now I've spent the money on it so I'll just have to wait it out.

Now its July 2nd and although I'm now able to receive calls there is static and calls breakup all the time. I'm working from home as well so this is a serious problem. I'm on hold waiting for them now. I'm in Sykesville, MD. I think it's all part of the Sprint merger because this complaint seems to be all over the country.

Yet the status is still "pre-shipment - usps awaiting item." Not sure if it is one of those times where they don't scan it in and it just magicly and randomly shows up to my home with no tracking updates. Those instances has happened a few times in the past.  Or maybe it's super backed up and they just haven't gotten to it

Aiming the dish keeps telling me wrong satellite also. I do believe I am going to drop Dish and just stream what I want to watch especially because quality is not there and prices keep going up.

4978024192	2020-07-03T13:39:35	disqus_dE1VEWJJnN	istheservicedown	I was with at&t for 10 plus years. Even through the crashes that apparently happened I had service enough to look at the weather on my phone or send a text or make a call. Or do anything on my phone for that matter. I switched to sprint a few years ago and honestly it became my favorite and most trusted provider. The instant they merged with TMobile. Everything went to shit. All I can do on my phone is stare at a blank screen. If they do not fix these issues I can guarantee with how things are looking they will lose my business and my loyalty. As well as many other’s business And loyalty. I’ve worked in the business Industry for a very long time. With this outlook of continuous issues and no solutions. No announcements to calm the outrage and horrible customer service. Their company may possibly fail completely. To be honest. I. REALLY. HOPE. IT. DOES.  To clarify I’m out in Jonestown PA 17038. I’ve been through Lebanon, philly, Lancaster, Harrisburg etc (I travel a lot) And my phone has not worked for a single minute since they completed their merging.

Spent over an hour trying resolve on 611-two calls and two agents only to have the problem come back the next day. Was told AT&T had a "bad tower" near me and that I needed to get Customer Service to put in a report so that maybe they would finally fix it. As long as it's an intermittent problem I guess I'm out of luck and will be looking for another service provider after over 10 years with Cricket and recommending them to others.

I have no limit on devices and monitor it daily. we pay for the best service and be lucky if we see over 100mb/s your company needs to stop sucking internet from country areas and sending it to the cities. I pay for something I should be getting at least relatively around the area.

4979818165	2020-07-05T00:24:57	ashtonethridge	istheservicedown	No service in the Woodstock, GA or Atlanta area!! My service was fine on June 28th and then it progressively started getting worse!! I have NO service in my home at all when I had it in the same house 4 days ago! I can call and text over wi-fi but my signal keeps cycling between 1-3 bars, 3 bars with a 1x next to it, or just no service at all!! And even when it shows I have 3 bars of LTE, I will try to call someone and I just hear silence on my end and their phone doesn’t ring at all. So I have to hang up and try and call again. I’ve troubleshot my phone multiple times and even replaced the SIM card, but to no avail. At this point, I’m not sure if it’s a cell tower/service issue or if it’s my phone itself. I have an iPhone XR running iOS 13.5.1. Anyone else having issues similar to this??

My dad is on hospice and it is imperative that my mother be able to make calls to the Hospice Nurses. They have absolutely no way to call out. God forbid something terrible were to happen. AT&T sure wants their money when its due, but they offer little to no service... and they sure as hell won't give you a discount for the time that you were without service.  This has been going on well over a week now. Get your crap together, AT&T!

If I didn't live in HUD housing I would be having a much different internet provider right about now. I get fucked out of $80 every month for a shity internet service that is presently down for "maintenance" here's an idea concast, instead of giving literally everyone unlimited internet by pushing a button and raping people's wallets of those who actually pay for unlimited internet why not just make it to where everything is a cheap cheap af price, high speeds and unlimited and call it done? this stupid Xfi advantage bulshit you push is all obviously just bullshit and not needed because if someone down the street only pays for the basic of basic internet and they have unlimited without the xfi advantage what the fuck am I paying for? oh that's right I'm paying because you guys want to fuck people out of money for a shity service and tack on fees and other car salesman bullshit! Instead of trying to rape people out of money they don't have, why not try to help Americans? This isn't communist Russia as much as you want it to be so solve the problem concast.

Can’t ever speak to a supervisor because they tell you they’re connecting you then they’ll hang up so you have to stay on hold for another hour . Most corrupt business I have ever encountered .

I sent my grandfather’s one of a kind leather jacket home on April 15. It’s been slow, but it finally got to Irving, TX post office 22 June, and has been sitting there since. I can’t open a claim online because I sent TO USA and not FROM. There’s no option for it. Can somebody please call or open a claim on my behalf? I can’t call from here either as I currently don’t have data or international calls. Irving post office number 972-986-6560. Thanks so much.-Chad

If this outage was SCHEDULE WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU NOT TELL ANYBODY?! I’ve waited 4 days for this one match and it’s all over because of this sh*t. Do you also realize how damaging this is to some people???! So many individuals and groups are working from home due to the corona virus pandemic and they are dependent on a good and stable internet, then you go and leave them. Comcast, is this your costumer support? Is it really? I have never been so disappointed in my life. Not now and not ever. What are you gonna do? Tell me to restart my gateway? What about the ranked match I lost on league? What about people’s job being interrupted? What about the kids that are home alone while their parents work and now have no way to communicate?

Why even charge for this service, this is a R&D beta level offering and we should get it for free as a promotion to help provide feedback. Paying the same price as a customer who gets full service is just wrong by every measure of business standards.
4985907106	2020-07-09T19:59:37	disqus_iARdSUSjzT	istheservicedown	Here’s the thing, I just don’t want it lost. I don’t know how it could get all the way there and then nothing. It’s a slap in the face. At least get lost in customs or something but to be lost at his front door? He went there and they said they’d look for it but he didn’t open a claim so I doubt they will. They can return to me, get it to him, whatever. I don’t care. I just don’t want it lost. I’m helpless because I feel a claim would move it along but how do I open one? I shipped Correos (USPS in Spain)

They set my phone and the wife's phone to LTE and switched off 5G.Voice calls (if it works) sounds like crap. Texting is hit and miss and is slow motion with a 50/50 chance of it getting thru or failing and trying to resend. Internet is also slow motion IF it works. I dislike Verizon with a passion but at least they can keep a voice and data network up and running.I also see a message my Sim card is being updated or addressed multiple times.I am using two brand new Samsung S20 phones which were working fine prior to yesterday and today. Tmobile needs better engineers or hardware to fix their mickey mouse network.

As of today, June 10, 2020, my mail containing the money order is still "stuck" and USPS website has not updated since yesterday giving me no further info other than it is within the USPS network and on track to be delivered.  Five days stuck at the Brooklyn, NY facility for a Brooklyn, NY delivery? Over a week since mailed out; it should have gotten to its destination within two days. While most people at USPS are very nice and good at their jobs such as yourself, Max, others are not competent or are they just lazy? I have observed this  many times over the last few years. I mentioned this to a USPS manager that I have known for many years just before he retired recently. He said that the benefits for the new USPS hires these last few years are not the same as in the past. Salary is not as good, pensions nil. USPS hires people, but then they leave quickly because the jobs don't provide what the new hires expected and so, they either leave or slack on their jobs because they feel they need more and they aren't getting it. He admitted that the postal carriers and clerks hired over the last few years are in a constant revolving door: hired this week, voluntarily gone the next. For many years I knew my mail carrier, same carrier every day, talked with him, offered him a cold drink in the summertime. Now I never have the same mail carrier for more than a day or two. Last year I was awaiting a $10,000 check from a party whose office was local to me. He said it was mailed out, but when I did not receive the check after two weeks, I called my local USPS. I was told that I had a new carrier and he wasn't too familiar with the route yet; that I should give it some time for the mail to be delivered to me and that her office would speak with the carrier and get back to me. I never heard from anyone so I called the party who sent me the check and told him to put a stop on it, issue me another check and Fed Ex it to me. He became rather irate because he had to pay to stop the check, pay higher fee for Fed Ex, etc. and he let me know he was upset in no uncertain terms. The mail carrier must have delivered it to another address and the person who received it didn't have enough respect to have it delivered to its rightful party (me). I say this because the party who sent the check never had it returned to him nor did I ever receive it in my mailbox. Another time I had a mail carrier come to my home to deliver mail from the sheriff's office (looked like home foreclosure papers). As I had no issues with the sheriff or the law, I looked at the address on the envelope and saw it was for a neighbor around the corner.  The mail carrier got the house number right, but the street wrong. Such a simple thing, but he didn't bother to pay attention to the street on the envelope. When I brought it to his attention and told him the street was around the corner, I emphasized to him that the mail might very well be a foreclosure notice for the party's home and that if they didn't receive the notice in a timely fashion, the party could lose their home by default. His reaction to my telling him this fell flat. The fact that this mail carrier didn't pay attention to the address on such an important mailing or cared about such a mistake bothered me for days. Over the last few years, I get my neighbors' mail, they get mine. Unfortunately, that is the way it is now; you have to hope your neighbors are nice enough to either bring you your mail or give it back to the carrier with a note that it was delivered to the wrong address. I can't tell you how many times I have done my best to get wrongly delivered mail to my address into the hands of its rightful recipient. It's the right thing to do after all. You have to hope that there is not something important that you are not receiving (like the sheriff's letter for the neighbor around the corner). When I told the USPS manager this, he nodded his head in acknowledgement.  He told me that USPS is not hiring under the same "threshold" it used to; that it has lowered its prior hiring standards because of its lower pay scale, reduced benefits, lack of pension compared to years past. On top of this, he added that the new hires only receive 3-4 days training before they are "thrown out" into the field or office to commence working. How can they a good job if they don't have the much needed training? And, without that training they are slower and make more mistakes, he told me. Mail carriers who work for USPS have been shown in the news to have been arrested for throwing the mail loaded in their mail trucks into dumpsters and garbage pails so as not to deliver them. It's crazy! Further, most times now when I send business mail out certified, RRR, I never get confirmation (green card) back with signature, but I certainly am paying for it!  Lastly, for the past 10 years someone has been having mail sent to my residence address using it as their address and no matter how many times (hundreds of times) I speak with local USPS supervisor, give the parties' names who live here so as to only have mail with our names delivered to my home and not the people whose mail I continue to get, USPS has done nothing to fix the problem. The supervisor said that he knows the correct address of these people who keep having their mail sent to my address, but he is unwilling to solve the problem. It's gotten so bad that if you look up my address on the internet these people show up as living at my address all these years as these internet companies are obtaining their info from public records. USPS won't give me the correct address for these people of course, but I would like to talk with them about the problem.  Instead, I just keep spinning in a circle, writing "AKA"  and "Return to Sender" on the envelopes and giving them back to the carrier as the supervisor instructed me to do.  There is absolutely no way for me to contact these people to tell them to stop their mail from coming to my home and coming up at my address on every internet site including the White Pages (their telephone number, of course, does not come up, only my address). My local USPS won't do anything about this problem. Again, something needs to be changed because USPS works for its customers and its customers are not getting proper service. If this is all about money then perhaps USPS must reconsider and open up its wallet to get this fixed as this is of national as well as international mail delivery concern. If the issues are about replacements who are being interviewed not being "up to snuff", but willing to take a lower pay and benefits, don't hire them.  If it has to do with lack of training, they should be trained properly.  If the issues are about benefits and pay, then competent and diligent new hires need to be compensated commensurate to others equal to their jobs so as to do their jobs to the best of their abilities for the USPS customers. If some of the USPS workers still cannot do their jobs after all of that, then they need to be let go. There are plenty of unemployed, intelligent, hard-working people who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 who would love a chance at working for USPS if it takes good care of its employees. Meanwhile, I want nothing more than for my money order to be delivered to its rightful recipient in Brooklyn, NY ASAP.            Thanks for allowing me to vent.

4988165098	2020-07-11T17:16:07	kathiclark	istheservicedown	No coverage in parts of Carmichael, CA.  My parents have not had cell service at their house for going on 5 days.  If I drive a mile away with their phones, the service is just fine.  This is the first time they have had no service at their house in the years that they have had Verizon.  It took me two service reps and nearly an hour to even get a ticket number.  The reps kept trying to figure out what was wrong with the phone.  I kept having to explain that it is affecting both phones on the plan and that there is no problem a mile away.  They are in their 80s and driving a mile away to make a phone call is not an option for them.  What are they supposed to do if they have a medical emergency?

4988209066	2020-07-11T17:56:33	disqus_UDXmeDTogg	istheservicedown	Verizon Wireless 4Glte signal strength has been on a steady decline for months now and it is occurring in areas which have had the strongest signals to date. I am referring to Pittsburgh, Oakmont, Penn Hills, Natrona Heights and so on. When calling customer service they claim there is nothing wrong and I am falsely reporting even with screen shots proving the signal bars at a steady 2 bars or even switching to 3g service believe it nor not. I cant believe with the technology out there we are even having these issues. It's because they are shutting down towers to save money but continue to raise prices. They have a pure monopoly on the phone service and know we cant switch to the far inferior sprint or boost mobile.

4988375958	2020-07-11T20:31:24	None	istheservicedown	I've had a number of recent disruptions (roughly every other night).  While watching Netflix, some time between 9-10 PM my cable modem (Arris SBG10) resets/restarts and cannot connect to the network.  I have local wifi, but no internet connection.  No program guide, only access to the last cable channel I had watched before streaming.  This condition lasts more than an hour.  I don't wait to see how long.  By morning all service is back to normal.  As this sequence has repeated a number of nights, it doesn't feel like a problem isolated to my service address.  Is this a central network problem?  If so, is there something I can do to re-establish service (other than waiting until morning)?

They said they would have someone come out and look at it once the outage was fixed yesterday. Well it’s been 24 hours and we have seen no one and we are still having issues. They have the worst service. I guarantee when they do send someone, that person won’t be able to work over time and spend at most 20 min here (because that’s only the amount of time they can work with out getting overtime) and not fix the problem. Then we won’t seen another person for two more days. Since that is what happens every time they send someone to fix things.

Without assistance from my calls to fedex, I decided to draft a letter with this pertinent information and submit by email or fax so that someone who can assist. Of course my email was not delivered and no fax # was available. I decided to request another pick up of the 2 packages on 7/6/2020 with the hope that I can speak to the courier to ask about my packages. Fortunately the courier  who showed up on 7/6/2020 was the same one in the picture and he told me that my packages were at the warehouse at Alamo Downs Parkway here in San Antonio. Of course there is no telephone number or email address to reach this office. The 2 packages are addressed to my sister EMLYN ADAMS # 45 CENTENARY STREET PRINCESS TOWN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO IN THE WEST INDIES .Kindly supply me with some guidance as to my next course of action to have these packages removed from the warehouse and mailed.  Best Regards, Wilma La Croix.

They say "we need to send out a tech to check your equipment".That's so they can say your personally owned modem is bad and charge you for the service call. My modem works perfectly fine when there's actual connectivity on their line.

Once in a while I would turn it on, and I could not find a signal at all most of the time.Another thing I noticed: the connections/disconnections were happening during the work days mostly around 9am, 12 pm and 6 pm, or about one would expect the highest volume of calls to happen.

4992180169	2020-07-15T00:02:07	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	The US Postal Service's new Postmaster General has established new cost-saving policies that could slow down mail service.Mail carriers are being told to leave mail behind at distribution centers rather than taking late trips, taking extra trips, or logging overtime, according to memos first reported on by The Washington Post and subsequently reviewed by Business Insider. The Postal Service is on financially shaky ground due to the coronavirus pandemic, with Business Insider previously reporting that it may run out of cash by the end of September. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.As it struggles to stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic, the US Postal Service has implemented "difficult" cost-cutting measures that may slow mail delivery, The Washington Post first reported. The changes, established by the USPS's new Postmaster General, Louis Dejoy, were disseminated Monday in memos that were viewed by The Post, verified by the American Postal Workers Union, and corroborated to The Post by three people with knowledge of the documents who spoke under the condition of anonymity. Business Insider also obtained and reviewed the memos.In the documents, Dejoy instructed workers to stop logging overtime and to leave mail at distribution centers if it would delay their route."If the plants run late, they will keep the mail for the next day," reads one of the documents. "If you get mail late and your carriers are gone and you cannot get the mail out without OT, it will remain for the next day."This new directive goes against the training postal workers traditionally receive, which says they should avoid leaving letters behind and should make sure items are delivered promptly, even if that means making multiple trips, The Post notes."One aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that — temporarily — we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks," a second memo states, adding that "any mail left behind must be properly reported."In the same document, the USPS said that late trips and extra trips — which it estimates cost the agency roughly $200 million in "added expenses" — are now prohibited. The cost-cutting policies come as the USPS is barely scraping by during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a ton of package deliveries, overall letter-mail volumes have plummeted since the pandemic began and businesses shuttered. Even with a $10 billion line of credit granted by the CARES Act, the Postal Service has found itself in dire straits — as of May, estimates were that the agency could run out of cash by the end of September. While acknowledging the Postal Service's rocky financial position, Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, sharply criticized the new measures — arguing they hit at the very core of the agency's mission, which is to "provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service.""These additional moves by the new Postmaster General seem to be sending the opposite message, which is that mail can wait," Dimondstein told Business Insider in a phone call on Tuesday. "It will likely undermine the mission we're dedicated to. And in terms of the people of the country, it will likely lead to slower, less prompt, and less reliable, and really less efficient service."When asked about the memos, a spokesperson for the USPS told Business Insider that the service is "developing a business plan" to remain financially stable while providing "reliable, affordable, safe and secure delivery of mail, packages and other communications to all Americans as a vital part of the nation's critical infrastructure.""While the overall plan is not yet finalized, it will certainly include new and creative ways for us to fulfill our mission, and we will focus immediately on efficiency and items that we can control, including adherence to the effective operating plans that we have developed," the spokesperson said. This story has been updated with comment from the US Postal Service.

However, It has been really bad lately. The majority of my shipments in May got stuck in In-Transit and never arrived. So I had to issue refunds for all the orders. Even with full insurance on all packages, we still loosing money due to penalty and late fees on the client contract. Do you think the service will improve soon or I should consider other shipping option?Thanks for your advice. Really apprciate it.Nhan

I think the remaining of the checks will arrive soon. I usually wait 30 days before filing a claim to give the facilities extra time. However, I'm running low on reserved fund so I don't think I can wait 30 days this time. Do you think it's safe to file the claim by the end of next week? (around July 24 or so?)I just read your post about the new Post Master. It's horrible to see that they try to dismantle the Post Office. The majority of postal workers I know are hard working individual who always do their best to deliver mails/packages all year round.

4992324912	2020-07-15T02:48:31	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Krystal i think your express mail was missent to another facility I feel that Oklahoma didn't treat it as express and it was co mingled with other mailExpress mail is supposed to be on the nose of the trailer not inside any container!I see this all the time in my facilityEmployees not paying attention to what they are doing or not trained properly!If you are the sender you will get your money back as we forfeit the postageAm very sorry about this!Max

Thank goodness for my Tmobile hotspot.  I've been with Tmobile for years.   My Tmobile hotspot did NOT stop, stutter, and buffer all day.  Maybe you might want to consult with Tmobile.
4992327973	2020-07-15T02:52:33	disqus_AFZUyUNgIY	istheservicedown	Thanks for response Max,So let’s say it got damaged is that something that the customer gets notified of? It would seem misleading to have one assume it’s still in transit and we keep waiting for an update only to realize your package was beyond repair and not know about it.
4992328720	2020-07-15T02:53:29	disqus_m6SPZN1S33	istheservicedown	So would you think it probably will arrive tomorrow ? My worry is on why it says it left Denver but then didn't show up at my post office , do you think maybe it got sent to the post office later In the day and just hadn't been scanned yet or is still at the distribution center ?
4992329227	2020-07-15T02:54:08	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Abraham they probably will send you the package back as received damaged or received without contents You should be notifiedMax
4992330961	2020-07-15T02:56:27	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	I think it's at the distribution center and they do a final dispatch in all the facilities so hopefully you will get it tomorrowMax

4992342741	2020-07-15T03:12:35	disqus_Ag8LOFs7fv	istheservicedown	Hi Max, thanks a lot for your help. So basically I still have a chance that my package will arrive? I’ve never had this happen before. Is California severely back logged with mail? It’s strange because when I contacted the United States postal service they replied saying that my package was never shipped. I knew that wasn’t true because it showed that my package was accepted on the 26th of June at a facility in San Francisco, Ca.

The other theory is that the shipper didn't actually ship it when they said they did. I was just trying to figure out which it was :(

These actions of the new PMG undermine our mission of service to the people of the United States and will drive away more business, all in the name of “cost savings.”Rather than cutting service, the most immediate solution to the COVID related financial crisis must come from congress. That’s why I’m asking you to join our #SaveThePostOffice call-in day of action on Thursday, July 23.Click here to sign up and be a part of the day.Postal workers have stepped up as heroes during this challenging and dangerous time --keeping the country, families and businesses connected.Private corporations have received billions of dollars in support from Congress, yet Congress and the Administration has yet to act when it comes to support for the public Postal Service.The House of Representatives voted to provide $25 billion in COVID related postal financial assistance in the HEROES Act, which included many positive provisions for working people. It is now in the hands of the Senate to act. Just last week S 4174 was introduced as a stand-alone bill in the Senate with a similar $25 billion of postal financial relief.This coming week, the Senate returns from recess to take up “stimulus” legislation. That’s why they need to hear from every one of us. That’s why I’m asking you to make a call to both your senators on July 23rd and insist on the $25 billion of emergency COVID relief for the Postal ServiceSign up here to participate in the call-in day of action.Sign up to join the call-in day and make sure your friends, family and your union family have signed up too. Let our voices be heard loud and clear! Our public Postal Service and jobs depend on it!In Union Solidarity,Mark DimondsteinPresident, APWU              1300 L Street NW, Washington, DC 20005 | www.apwu.org

4996380285	2020-07-18T07:59:22	disqus_wq3KFrL4Hb	istheservicedown	Thank you so much I appreciate it, I noticed that other one showed up. I did go to the post office today they said that they are about two weeks behind in pallets for packages. And that they show that my other packages are somewhere in the facility although it shows that the numbers are not valid for tracking. I have now had two additional packages transfer from FedEx today to USPS as well. They wouldn’t let me pick up packages due to not knowing exactly where they are yet. They said for future pick up I would have to watch the tracking number call them and then go out there before it gets on the truck. I wish there was a way for me to just always pick up my packages at the USPS - is there? Without getting a PO Box 📦
4996381467	2020-07-18T08:01:49	disqus_wq3KFrL4Hb	istheservicedown	I did contact UPS customer service they are the ones that I’ve been trying to deal with for the past week. They’re less than helpful, my mail person was more helpful and you - then any other service or anything I’ve Tried to do in the past seven days between calling going in and everything ♥️🙌♥️ I just was like stuck in this limbo Where no one can help and even the lady at the post office was like listen like I don’t know why you got a 26 digit tracking number it’s very weird🤣
4996382191	2020-07-18T08:03:17	disqus_wq3KFrL4Hb	istheservicedown	Yeah I seen that bullshit, with the postmaster general. Completely ridiculous.
4996394538	2020-07-18T08:29:37	disqus_wq3KFrL4Hb	istheservicedown	Yes he definitely does plan to delay mail. In order to cut costs. It’s not spreading lies 🙄 he literally said It. It’s part of his plan for USPS and phasing in different operations. And you know he acts like right now is a time where they can actually do that ???? When deliveries are at an all time high and when half of the staff is sick Or dying so the other half of the of the staff now is not allowed to work overtime to ensure that your fucking mail gets delivered. We’ll see how this plays out when you stop getting mail,  because instead of ensuring that our USPS Frontline workers are getting taken care of the way that they need to be to ensure us Americans receive our mail; he’s cutting their hours cutting their OT and nobody gives a shit that the virus is hitting them Hard. I’ve never once had a problem with USPS ever until this new postmaster general comes in (with no USPS experience) let’s see what else the Trump administration can destroy ! Bottom line businessmen do not give a shit about people they give a shit about business and money that is all. I highly doubt he cares about all the people that are dying or that over half of the Postal Service is sick with Covid. But he don’t listen to Max he’s just a fucking USPS employee,🙄🙄🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ DR from your comments it doesn’t seem like you give a crap about them either.
4996395231	2020-07-18T08:31:01	disqus_wq3KFrL4Hb	istheservicedown	Max, I care 💚 thank you for everything that you do every day I appreciate you also getting on here and helping so many people with the issues that they have been experiencing you are a gem👌
4996423643	2020-07-18T09:29:36	disqus_wq3KFrL4Hb	istheservicedown	I had the same type of issue at the warren USPS on mound, I went in today and their pallets are waaaaay backed up. I personally Could not pull up any of the tracking numbers I had (said invalid or not trackable etc). But I went in to the USPS today and they were able to find the package , confirm it’s was there just not scanned from a pallet yet since it wasn’t unloaded. Warren USPS is super backed up and half of their staff is sick and has been Per the staff and my mail lady I spoke w today too, and the USPS postmaster general cut OT for them ,they don’t answer the phone ever I swear lol it’s frustrating but go in there and talk to the lady at the desk with your tracking numbers (not inside Lobby) at the window and she will be able to see if they are at least there! And give you a printout which you may be able to just pick up your package there too or you’ll have to comeback or wait for delivery. But it’s a little better having the ease of mind too ! had one package she was able to pull and hand to me cause they literally just unloaded the pallet from the 8th and the other one I have to follow up on. However the actual trackers still don’t show up in the USPS system. I suggest going in and talking to someone, that’s the only way to confirm if package is actually there if you can’t track like I couldn’t ! ☺️

4998443598	2020-07-20T03:38:21	nansmithnansmith	istheservicedown	In the month of July I have experienced problems with Amazon packages not arriving on time or simply just never arriving.     Tracking numbers show  high incidence of USPS not ever receiving package.  Other tracking numbers show packages seem to be stalled at unidentified carriers.  This past week 13-18th I went 3 days without any mail delivery, not even advertizing or solicitations.  Odd.  However on the 17th I tracked a package to arrival in Iron Mountain.  I should have received it Friday or Sat at the latest.  On Friday I received some advertizing and one bill but no packages.  On Saturday I received 2 letters and a magazine but no package.  Today Sunday I rechecked the tracking number which showed package was unable to access delivery area?   This made no sense.  My mail was delivered early to mid afternoon.  At no time was my street blocked and I was home all day.Something funny is going on.  I now have checked tracking information on 2 other older packages and Amazon tells me if I don't get them in another day I can get a refund?    Anyone have any information about problems with the mail delivery system in Escanaba Mi?

Im concerned it is lost and it was an irreplaceable package so i am already worried since this message gives me no details on where it is. Also i have searched the web and found many people that have lost mail receiving the same message. I will definitely wait it out for a week before filing a claim if it is still not arrived, but i was wondering if you would be able to provide any information on my package.

4999710883	2020-07-21T02:54:42	TheRealSugarBalls	istheservicedown	Internet in and out for over two months much worse lately. I called to cancel then they offered me their one megabyte thing and I accepted that saying that it doesn't matter how fast it is I need it to be consistent because I work from home. So the guy comes out and gives me the new modem checks everything says it's good it seems to work fine and then he leaves about a half hour later it's doing the same thing. So I called again to cancel they said let's have a tech come out and look at it so the guy came out today said that the levels in the line were a little off a blah blah blah. Didn't do anything to the computer not even look at the computer. I said hey maybe I've got a setting wrong or something, he said he didn't know anything about computers which was really discouraging. So he hangs out for about 15-20 minutes and things are good and then just now let's say 3 and 1/2 hours after he left it's doing the same thing, I'm offline again and customer service said that there's an outage in my area, that's BS these guys suck. I'm canceling tomorrow even though AT&T is slower it seems to be more reliable I have their service too..I was comparing the 2 services. I am in St. Joseph, MO.

This is a mess. Seems like when Comcast truck are coming out their doing half the work for a quick fix. Internet services for me go out at night each time I’ve had it happen. So sad to say they don’t mind cutting off your services for non payment but won’t credit enough to your account for an outage you have nothing to do with!

Once it is authorized it goes through. BAD and paypal wont refund you. It is a glitch on the website and the seller won't help and you never get a receipt.

5000129856	2020-07-21T13:30:15	bretbengard	istheservicedown	They are spotty in the rural Lassen county area of N. CA, especially south county.  What ticks me off, is that we've been completely down almost 24 hours and there no statement as to why, and if you try to access why through there website, they tell you there's no problem.  We pay a a fortune for three phones terrible service and reception.

5000299325	2020-07-21T15:47:49	disqus_6ac6g2Q4sB	istheservicedown	My order was international priority from Hong Kong to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I ordered on 07/18/20 and it was supposed to be here yesterday, 07/20/20. The delivery date is now changed to today 07/22/20. However, I called the customer service and they said it is held up for a reason that is out of their control. That its not customs related but they couldn't give me anymore information than that. The lady I spoke with could not tell me when it will be cleared and just told me they would send me an update when something moves. Very frustrating to pay $20 for international Priority to get regular slow shipping. I will not be receiving my packages before an event I needed it for.

If it is registered and insured and requires a signature it will take longer. I do believe that the USPS in many areas of the country are currently understaffed for whatever reason. The question is why ? ( summer vacations ?) I am getting the same situation here in Southeast Michigan. I know for a fact that the USPS staffs are working very hard and overtime.  From all signs I do believe your package is safe but will unfortunately will take longer. Hold tight and be safe. Best regards.
5001493544	2020-07-22T13:45:56	disqus_2z3Tgl4fcm	istheservicedown	Your package is probably safe but will take longer to arrive. Currently a number of USPS locations are experiencing low staffs for whatever reason. ( vacation times, retirements, Covid 19 related ?). I know for a fact from personal trips to a number of  USPS stations that the understaffed USPS for the most part are working extremely hard under a great deal of pressure. Keep tight and be safe and best regards.

It is probably a combination of currently understaffed employees ( Vacations, retirements and covid related ) as well as the fact that there appears to be an increase of postal related commerce due to the shutdowns across the country increasing mail order products rather than direct buying.

It was received at the Olive Branch Ms location at 241pm which is about 5 hrs from me, and hasn’t moved since. I called FedEx & was told that olive branch is over a week behind & my package is smart post so not to expect it for at least 2 weeks. Why even schedule it to be delivered today when they knew it was going to sit in olive branch for over a week? I have another package coming from the same place, scheduled to be delivered Friday, actually no it just changed to Saturday lovely, so I won’t get it for over 2 weeks either apparently. Then customer service spoke to me as if I am the problem for even calling them. I should just expect it to be late & be fine with that. Well I’m not. Especially when I’m told it will be here on a certain day, and it isn’t.

This one hasn’t moved or updated from Louisville since early Sunday.

Like northern Canada, many African countries, etc. They have clearly stated it’s not for anyone in cities with access to higher speed internet. This is to keep the costs down and the traffic less congested so they can deliver semi-high quality internet to those places.

5003849414	2020-07-24T05:58:54	None	istheservicedown	@MaxStockHi Max, You seem to be the friendly interweb mail hero around here. Wondering if I could get your insights on this. I have three packages in transit (2 being shipped to me and 1 I've shipped); however, the two most troublesome have the Los Angeles Distribution center in common as their blackhole for dropping off the face of the planet.  Package A to me has been "in transit, arriving late" since the 19th with the same message being generated through the 22nd. Does anyone know what the estimated delay times are for this particular hub? The package I shipped said it was dispatched from the USPS International  Distribution Center on July 11th and was followed with "in transit to the next facility" everyday after until July 15th when it fell off the face of the planet. What strikes me as odd as it shows the package as not having left the Los Angeles Distribution Center. My question is, is it really in transit and was transferred to the military postal service (it's headed overseas for a service member), or has it joined so many other parcels in the abyss? I appreciate any help and your time!

This has become a pattern of no service for hours out of a day.  This is affecting our work at home, our security, and endless possibilities of Xfinity receiving legal ramifications.  Everyday and Everynight we have been without service. If someone did need to call from medical help, they have no phone service to do so.  If someone is trying to perform work in which they are compensated, they cannot because they have no internet service.  Furthermore, your home alarm and cameras don't work because you have no internet.   This is ridiculous and requires an explanation and compensation for lost time.  My service seems to be off more then its working and these are just a few dates that come to mind.  Then when you report your outtage, you are unable to speak with a real person.  And their system will ask you if you would like a notice once your service is corrected, via text or email.  They either never notify you or as soon as you hang up they send something saying your service is back up.  And it's not.  Xfinity your services is BAD right now and you need to fix it.  Or risk losing customers to C-Spire.  Thats the bottom line.

I have a priority package (huge box, 26 by 16 by 11 - 20 lbs) that was suppose to arrive 3 days ago. The last real scan is arriving at Newark NJ distribution center. Since then, it’s been the ‘In Transit Arriving Late’ scan daily. I assume it’s either still in Newark NJ or it’s on a truck somewhere to TX? Tracking is: 9205590221582710579197.

5004986068	2020-07-25T02:55:27	disqus_Ag8LOFs7fv	istheservicedown	Well I guess it’s safe to say now that my package is lost, and it will never arrive. My package was shipped on the 26th of June from San Francisco California, and it’s now July 24th, and no movement since reaching Burlingame, California on the 26th of June! This mail is a mess, and I’m now afraid to order a package ever again until this mess gets straightened out, if it ever does! Also my mail is taking forever to receive getting shipped only an hour away from where I live now. It takes me over 2 weeks to receive an envelope from someone that lives only 1 hour away from me. I hope everyone else receives their packages, but I’m just frustrated by what’s happening with my mail, and whatever happened to my package at this point. I’m starting to believe what I’ve heard and that is someone is tampering with the packages that are being shipped. I called the usps to try and get some closure to what’s going on, and I filed a missing package claim with no luck, or help at all. Good luck everyone!

5005021446	2020-07-25T03:51:04	randybayer	istheservicedown	Of the three major carriers, USPS, UPS, and FedEx, UPS is the worst of a lot. I’ve had a lot of trouble with them over the years. I ordered a replacement part for an appliance on Monday with guaranteed 2nd Day delivery and it is Friday and the package is still not here. The package has been in Memphis since Wednesday, but the tracking aways says it is “out for delivery” but the package never arrives. I paid $28 for the expedited service and they didn’t live up to their guarantee. Their website now says that they can’t honor their guarantee because of the virus. So why are they offering this service when they know they can’t provide it. It’s fraud. they are charging for a service that they don’t render. I always tell shippers not to ship with UPS WHEN I CAN.
5005023657	2020-07-25T03:54:39	Dr_ML_Shanks	istheservicedown	Max, sounds like an lame excuse...I'm in CA, and most of the mail is moving just fine.  Santa Clarita (my closest processing center) is averaging <12 hour throughput.....while LA Central is closer to 24 hours.  Yet my priority mail package shipped  to Citrus Heights (a suburb of Sacramento) has been sitting at the Sacramento distribution center since July 21, 2020, 12:44 pm....and it's 8:45 pm, July 24, 2020.  That's 80 hours, more than 3 days.  If Fedex or UPS were delaying a two day delivery package more than 3 days in a sorting center, heads would roll.  But no one seems to give a %$#@(*& at the USPS.

No internet, no phone, no tv... nothing.  Rebooted/restarted router many times.  It will sometimes run for maybe 10 minutes to a couple of hours and then out again. Most of the time, the reboot does nothing. Wish they would just be honest about what is going on, whether a tower was damaged or if it’s hacking.. whatever. Luckily I have an Att mobile or I would be totally blocked from the world.  I’ll never put all my eggs in one basket.  We should all get some kind of refund this month for days without services we have all paid for.

5005745254	2020-07-25T20:22:33	Assault_is_eternal	istheservicedown	FYI: I've read that there's a backlog at Jersey City.  I ordered something, it entered Jersey City on July 17th, and was supposed to arrive on the 20th.  I got a notification on the 21st letting me know that it was "In transit".  I just got a notification saying that it arrived at my local post office with a delivery date of Monday the 27th.  So if I get it on Monday, there's at least a week's backlog there.

But it’s been over 24hrs with no update except “it’ll be late” and it shouldn’t take that long to get a Priority package from MN to WA. So I’m trying to figure out whether it got lost or damaged during transport and they’re just not telling me. And now I’m seeing on this website that my local USPS branch is apparently one of the higher issue ones right now, and have had a rather... colorful... history with them and packages/mail, so I’m extra worried. 😳

I pay for YouTube, so I log on to my paid account from the pc, and try starting listen to playlists I’ve built. Then I go work, but for the last few years, YouTube won’t play more than 4-5 tracks in a row, After that it derails and does what it wants, which has created a number problems for me at my day job. I’ve tried turning on loop playlist but that’s a joke. I’ve been literally complaining to youtube for years and have gotten no reply no help, nothing. I feel like I’m just being fucked with now, and if I had an alternative to YouTube, I would of switched. Every day I try using YouTube on a computer it’s been nothing but trouble, everyday, three days a week that I’m here to use it. A play list with 420 tracks, all of which are at least three minutes long should not have to be restarted at all that same day, I should be able to listen it with out having to hear the same video twice. But I have to restart play lists every fifteen minutes or so.

I get we are in a "pandemic" but i had packages get to their destinations quicker when we were all in the middle of the lockdown! This is incredibly frustrating!

Being the only BlacK woman in the complex I am feeling concerned and begging to be wrong. I am the only person having delivery issues. And had gotten all my packages on time even during a pandemic. This particular shipment had 3 different tracking numbers and UPS claims responded to my email saying that Gary Bailey at 967 Hilltop Drive in Chula Vista had received the package. Something feels really scammy.

There are never any credible answers from customer service reps.“Shame on Spectrum”!!- especially during these critical times of a Pandemic -as the public depends on internet for working & schooling from home.Internet is up & then minutes later, its out -again, all day & intermittent for weeks. Impossible to work, make calls or live stream with out internet. “Spectrum is a Dysfunctional Company!”When calling Spectrum to inform of problems the automated system is ridiculously long & time consuming before a live person answers. Hold times for a person is agonizing. When you finally get a live person, they have no pertinant information to inform of what the actual problem may be & never have any further information for the public. A BIG SECRET.Spectrum is the WORST of the WORST.A Giant Monopoly. Consumers are prisoners of a Pathehetic Dysfunctional Product and Very Bad Business Practices!Contact the New York Attorney General, State Senator, Congressman & FCC!!Make Your Voice Heard !!!!!Make sure you get refunded $$$ from your inconvenience from this defunct company.

5008579258	2020-07-28T07:10:18	kimmysayz	istheservicedown	The USPS has BEGGED for more money in order to stay operational and TRUMP refuses to give it to them.  THANKS TRUMP!  Look it up people! Trump wants to make the USPS a privately owned and operated business - it's a federal business at the moment that is being horribly neglected and under funded! Trump is also complaining about mail in ballots - I strongly recommend that anyone who submits a ballot "by mail' uses a government approved drop off box and not the post office.
5008588028	2020-07-28T07:27:35	kimmysayz	istheservicedown	I think a lot of people were taking the USPS for granted.  Some people don't miss a good thing until it's gone.  Your vitrual mail can never take the place of getting your physical mail.  If the USPS became privately owned would we have a mash up of stamps? Who accepts them and who doesn't?  I can't begin to imagine what a privately owned post office service would look like.  We've had an official postal service since 1792.  I can't imagine that one private company could overtake the entire USPS system.  Maybe I'm wrong?

However, when I upload my FIT files, Garmin Connect gives me 0 steps for July 23-4. I can delete the July 23-24 files and then upload again, but I still get 0 daily steps despite each FIT file showing the step count for that activity. Do other users have problems with July 23-4?

We are repeatedly told by the customer service “techs” that it’s our modem and it’s not their equipment. Bought a new modem and the tech that was trying to help us set it up couldn’t get it working and said we do not have a problem with our modem that there is a outage on their end. But the customer service continues to lie to us about there not being outages and it is our equipment that has problem. Garbage customer service And lack of accountability.

5010334818	2020-07-29T15:21:36	disqus_93GU0U6eSM	istheservicedown	This is, BY FAR, the worst internet provider I have ever had, in my entire life. I think even AOL dial up internet was better than these idiots, when I was like 10 years old. Cox should absolutely be ashamed of themselves. They charge an arm and a leg, but give us sub-par internet service. Absolute TRASH!!!!
5010337338	2020-07-29T15:23:33	disqus_93GU0U6eSM	istheservicedown	That’s their answer to everything, because they are a garbage company who hire garbage technicians. They tell you that it’s your equipment, because they are too stupid to figure out what the real issue is.

They're the only ones that have speeds higher than 100mbps. I have 35+ devices connected to my wifi so I need all the bandwidth I can get. Realty hoping 5G rolls out to homes soon here so I can drop this POS company. Oh, and they prey on the elderly. My in-laws pay over 300 for basic cable, phone and 100mbps internet and because they don't understand how to change their plan, they just left it. Spectrum is quick to take you off your promotional plans but will leave you on antiquated more expensive plans no problem. F**k em.

5012031563	2020-07-30T20:58:12	disqus_BfZWJ4PPpx	istheservicedown	Lower Connecticut total blackout. That includes no notification of any kind from Verizon, nothing. Just a very difficult to find thread buried in the account section IF you're logged in, and only then could I find a "Verizon has detected an outage in your area." With people working from home, not having a landline and Internet can cost a fortune. It's hard to fathom a total lack of redundancies so that something could pull through. No direct notice from Verizon and no way to forward a business line. For days. PLURAL. By the time it's restored, Optimum will arrive and be done with VZN as a primary network source.

5012837917	2020-07-31T14:23:32	None	istheservicedown	Hi Max! Found this thread and we really appreciate your help! My brother sent a USPS Priority Mail Large Box on July 22 from San Diego CA and it was scheduled to arrive to Richmond VA on July 25. The last update received was on July 26 with the infamous "In Transit, Arriving Late." I went ahead and submitted a Service Request on Monday July 27. The local post office in Richmond got in touch a couple hours after submitting the Service Request and said that the package had not left CA yet. They provided me the Consumer Affairs number at the San Diego Distribution Center. The Cons. Affairs rep on Wednesday (7/29) said that he was going to check if the package was still in the facility and would call me back (I still haven't received a call back). He then instructed me to submit a "Missing Mail" inquiry, and luckily, I was able to submit actual photos of all items in the box. The rep did say that the box may still be on it's wait (waiting for a commercial flight) or that it may have been damaged.All this said, is there anything else I can do at this point? Also thinking worst case scenario, if the package was damaged and the items (2 jackets) fell from the box, what are the probabilities that I'll be able to get them delivered? The tracking number is: 9405503699300464919435Thanks for your help!

5012880880	2020-07-31T15:00:07	homermariaassa	istheservicedown	OK. So what does it mean to file claim not later than 60 days if it was filed few days later than 60 days passed? Thx

5013005703	2020-07-31T16:45:13	disqus_7X60nJ9C2K	istheservicedown	Thanks Max.  I currently have 3 shipments from different locations inbound on USPS.  The numbers are as follows:920559021342402661662794055082054970546610249505513812270209664364The first one arrived in Shreveport on Sunday.  Normally that one should have been delivered on Monday.  The funny thing is that this parts order was split into two shipments. One came from Florida and was delivered 2 days ago. The other came from Dallas (a much nearer origin point) but it's still sitting at the distribution center undelivered. (A real estate closing is being held up waiting on this sink drain to arrive).  The second tracking number shipment was supposed to be delivered yesterday (30th), according to the date given when the item was ordered and the shipping option was selected at checkout. The third tracking number was only just shipped from California before I had the chance to tell the vendor to use another carrier.  It contains some very fragile, very hard to find, vacuum tubes for a radio rebuild.  Normally this vendor contact ships Priority.  But I don't know how it was shipped this time around.  So who knows when or if I will ever see it.I've had no problems with shipping during this entire covid thing.  And believe me I've got a long list of items that I've received over the past 7 months, usually anywhere from 4-10 packages per week.  And so far this year I've only had one package that was late...and that was only by one day.  So for this to suddenly start happening on multiple shipments all at once, without even being close to a holiday (mothers/fathers day, etc), something else is causing the problem.  Shreveport isn't that large of a town where a container from Dallas would just sit for 4-5 days without being unloaded.  What gives?David
5013006235	2020-07-31T16:45:41	None	istheservicedown	My internet has been out since this morning. Can’t do anything. I hope it gets fixed soon so I can finish my assignments for college.

5013027076	2020-07-31T17:02:42	None	istheservicedown	Hello. My package ( LS385683345CN ) has been stuck in San Francisco processing facility since the 24th. I only live an hour away from San Francisco so this is very frustrating. Any idea when it will come here?

It’s been three days and it looks like USPS still has not received it. I’m afraid it’s been lost. Any help?
5013051021	2020-07-31T17:22:41	disqus_71QyV2yqU0	istheservicedown	78516 still no internet 6 days and counting. @spectrum your recorded message of severe weather is bullshit. The message should read "we're sorry because of our lack of investing in infrastructure, a weakass storm knocked out services" severe weather... pathetic infrastructure
5013051150	2020-07-31T17:22:47	None	istheservicedown	we had a package out for delivery yesterday and the status was suddenly changed to "Delivery Attempt - July 30, 2020 - at 7:20 pm - Held at Post Office, At Customer Request". We had no mail delivered at all yesterday.I never made that request. Can I expect the package be delivered today? Do I need to pick it up at the post office?
5013059439	2020-07-31T17:29:42	None	istheservicedown	Thank you Max for your help here! I live in Los Angeles and my package (tracking: 9505513159900196434166) arrived at the LA distro center on the 15th. When I tracked my package on usps a couple days later, a new activity "Departed USPS facility" at Carson CA appeared and was backdated to the 15th. I am confused by the backdated activity and wonder where my package is currently.

5013073237	2020-07-31T17:40:49	None	istheservicedown	If it matters: the backdated activity was suddenly added on 7/21. Was it a glitch in the system?

5013169807	2020-07-31T18:59:14	pete_valdez	istheservicedown	Thornton CO. Internet has been out since yesterday. Folks have been asking questions here and not getting a response. I don't really care what happened, I would really like it to be resolved, and be given some sort of an ETA when it will be. This surely doesn't support us who are working from home. Perhaps providing data on my phone until this issue is resolved so I can hot spot/tether it to my PC would be the courteous resolve for now.

5013347401	2020-07-31T21:26:18	None	istheservicedown	Thank you for your response, but telling me that "It's in some facility somewhere" is of no help.  You mention Illinois-is there someone I can contact there?  What can I do at this point?  There clearly was a sender's address on the package, so why has it not been returned to me if it wasn't delivered?  It was a 7"x9" bubble wrap envelope sealed with filament reinforced filament tape with tracking, so it would have been very difficult to damage. The contents are very valuable and I need this package located!  I have submitted a second search through the post office, but since they didn't respond to my first search request, I am not optimistic about getting an answer to my second.
5013351574	2020-07-31T21:30:12	disqus_En1LnsCOTQ	istheservicedown	The internet signal in Barnegat Light NJ has been sporadic, and I lose internet, and get booted from my VPN app, every 10 minutes. It is virtually impossible to conduct business or even have a zoom meeting. Calls to customer service have me wasting my time unplugging and plugging the modem back in. They know the problem is with the signal, but nothing is being done. Good thing they are a monopoly on this island
5013353047	2020-07-31T21:31:38	None	istheservicedown	There is something going on at the Richmond Virginia distribution center. I have had a package in stasis there for an entire month. All attempts to get my package or even get a human to communicate have failed. I have given up and ordered a replacement from a different seller and THEY shipped it USPS and is now experiences an inexplicable delay. This is so frustrating. I want my items, or want USPS to pay for them. I've spent so much time dealing with this.
5013353737	2020-07-31T21:32:18	None	istheservicedown	Why is it said on this site that there are no outage issues in East Hartford when all of my service is down!

5013982684	2020-08-01T13:17:56	spencergorman	istheservicedown	As a seller who sends at least 150 first class, priority mail and media mail packages weekly and has for 20 years. Since the takeover of Postmaster General the mail of packages has been ridiculous. First class packages have been running 7-15 business days through Philadelphia Media mail which goes through Jersey City is now non-existent taking 30 days to be delivered LOCALLY this started once Our new Postmaster General stopped all Media Mail in Jersey City so if it was already in process and mailed in early July it is still sitting. I use a lot of Priority Mail average has been 7 days some taking 10 days to deliver. This is directly due to the idiot who took over. No more overtime for Postal Workers, no scZns for dropped off packages if they have not been scanned by the end of the day. And Media Mail is just being held and delivery time has been abominable. The Post Master General was put in place to help destroy our postal system and so it goes to Private Industry from Government. I have missed mail several days in a row as deliveries are now stopped due to no overtime Mail is so backed up that prescriptions are not arriving on time. This guy running the show is DANGEROUS and could care less about how people are struggling. Please write your Congressman and help get rid of this man. He is incompetent and destructive to all of us. Appoint a longtime Postal  Employee who understands the system.

I was also able to delete 15 messages and text my best friend that my phone was down. She has Cricket and has no problem and lives 30 miles from me.

Customer service rep said weak signal coming to our modem now and a tech can’t get out to look at it till next week. Unbelievable. Terrible company and service.

5014101357	2020-08-01T15:29:47	melparent	istheservicedown	Seriously getting pissed with CenturyLink. I've had to replace 3 modems because they send me refurbished modems with wrong AC adapters and not working properly. Brand new modem brand new computer and for the 24/48 hrs I can't stay connected for more then 30 minutes at a time. I do some part time work from home so I lose money when I can't do what I need to do. Seems I'm not the only one in the Albany/Lebanon, oregon area with this issue. If I had the option to go with another service in my RV park I would and I've been with centurylink for 10 plus years
5014101821	2020-08-01T15:30:18	AtomicFury	istheservicedown	Waze has been squirrelly for about the last month (July 2020). I travel outside Philadelphia and at times the voice doesn’t give commands even though I have it set to do so (instead of just providing alerts). There have also been instances where it gives nonsensical directions such as to make a left onto the highway I’m already on. I was on it for several miles at that point. Other than that, it’s been a perfect app for me.

5014253259	2020-08-01T17:34:04	amandavierling	istheservicedown	We have spent days going back and forth with Verizon to try to give my in-laws a timeframe for restored service. Much of their building is out and Verizon keeps giving us the run around. Took 50 minutes to get a CSR, then 30 minutes *after providing the ticket number*, to get someone to give us a service estimate time. Meanwhile a whole group of old folks in assisted living are in quarantine with no service...for about a week. This is the third estimate we've gotten. Verizon keeps moving the goalpost. Very frustrating.

I don't use more than 10 gigs a month, there is nothing else connected to it so there is no reason for this. And yes I power my cell off and still is the same. Thinking about getting a different internet provider, for the money I pay a month their quality of service is poor.

I really pack with lots of care but I guess nothing is perfect. It’s so frustrating to have no idea where these things are and if they’ll ever get delivered.

5015862039	2020-08-03T01:33:34	None	istheservicedown	Wellington, CO Been almost 24 hrs with no service, no internet nothing. They told me to just reset my phone like that would do anything! I am told maintenance on the towers was being done and they had no idea when it was going to be restored. This is unacceptable. People like myself who are not around Wi-Fi rely on this service for work and such. God forbid that an emergency might happen and we are stuck helpless. Your loyal customers are not going to take this and move on. If anything we should be given compensation for not providing what we pay good money for.

5016369749	2020-08-03T14:43:39	cindyjueckel	istheservicedown	Max, my suspicion is that these two packages are sitting in the Elk Grove Village Distribution Center. I say that because most of the other packages that I mail USPS Priority Mail start out by departing my local post office and then arriving at Elk Grove Village as the next stop. The one exception is the package which initially arrived at Palatine and then departed for parts unknown. It is likely sitting in the Elk Grove Village Distribution Center in my opinion.I have a question on how a distribution center like Elk Grove Village works, particularly when it becomes overwhelmed with packages. Do those packages eventually get scanned and sorted on a first-in first-out basis? Or, are packages randomly selected for scanning and sorting. I am just wondering what the average time is that packages sit idly and unscanned in the Elk Grove Village Distribution Center.Thanks again!

I had cox for 10 years, never, even once, did I have ANY issues. I have had Comcast for 5 years now and there is not a single day that I don’t lose my nerves because of their crappy coverage. (unfortunately due to my HOA forcing me, I had to switch to Comcast from Cox after I moved). I’ve had my modem switched multiple times, I have coverage extenders, I have done just about everything. Freaking Comcast has made my life miserable. I’m so done with it, but unless I sell my house and move, I can’t get rid of this horrible provider.

It says on July 28th that it “Departed USPS Regional Facility WAUSAU WI DISTRIBUTION CENTER” and every since the 29th it’s been saying  “ In Transit, Arriving Late Your package will arrive later than expected, but is still on its way. It is currently in transit to the next facility.” I’m worried.

It says it was delivered, but the parcel was not in my mailbox. It appears it’s been misdelivered... I’ve already opened a case with USPS since the post office was closed and they don’t respond to calls but last time this happened, they ended up never retrieving the item. What can I do? I’d be losing quite a big sum of money if the person that received it in the mail keeps it

Do those packages eventually get scanned and sorted on a first-in first-out basis? Or, are packages just randomly selected for scanning and sorting?In my recent experience, it seems to take 3 to 4 weeks for a package that arrived at the Elk Grove Village Distribution Center to finally be scanned, tracked and acknowledged to be in its possession. Is that about right? Is there anything that anyone can do to get these packages moving sooner than three to 4 weeks?

5017440788	2020-08-04T11:07:19	Superman622	istheservicedown	I'm currently having issues with TWO areas moving at a snails 🐌 pace and not getting good, up to date tracking information like I normally do. The two areas are Bedford, Texas and Waukesha, Wisconsin. Both areas have drastically delayed my packages and are giving me only generic updates, "In Transit, Arriving Late" which is pointless and worthless information. Yeah, I already know it's late or I wouldn't be here and I know it's moving somewhat hopefully since you're in possession of it, unless you guys somehow lost it, which would anger me even more than I already am! I understand COVID-19 but it hasn't effected my post office here in Yukon or out distribution hub in Oklahoma City one bit. I also know there's just some bad apples in the bunch to begin with and have been long before COVID-19 came into play. I have a feeling from reviews that these two sites are some of them. I just hope I get my stuff, late is better than not at all. Get your act together USPS!

Just curious mostly, what would cause a package to sit at a local for 3-4 days before being routed to a distro? I assume, barring other delays, this will get here Thursday, but I dont think I've ever seen a freeze like the lack of movement from Friday-Monday

5017819163	2020-08-04T17:03:43	disqus_750kOcX7ZY	istheservicedown	grrr, 3 days ago my regular sized package was scanned as in transit CICERO, IL and nothing since, today is supposed to be delivery day on the west coast.  Last time it was 'in transit' it took 48 hours just to arrive at a place an hour away.  USPO seemingly had no problems getting stuff to me in a reasonable amount of time, even coming from the east coast.  If it travels at that rate maybe it will arrive in cicero in another 2 weeks... and then 2 more months to make it to me.   I had a bad feeling about this package when it was originally shipped off over a week ago.

I refunded the buyer for purchase, just  very sad, these sales help me out on a monthly basis.  USPS is a service I can afford and it is frustrating to see this the service collapsing before our eyes. Congress can’t get their act together to help the American people at such Critical time in our nation,  USPS is not a priority and they don’t seem to want to fix the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.

Didnt lost power but internet wiped.  Not even the Optimum Wifi hotspot is showing up as an option so some tower or cable has to be down.
5018399046	2020-08-05T02:22:21	None	istheservicedown	I asked for an email confirming the time and location of the outage and an eta I spoke with one rep and two managers, mind you it was a 54 minute call, okay I understand, what I don’t understand is, how I was told they don’t have a policy that allows them to send emails about the outage, the solution was to add my manager to the account so she can call in, to screen shot the app or online or do a three way call. My internet has been out since 10am eastern, I work remotely and need to provide documentation for my job of the outage, a screen shot is not sufficient nor the least bit professional. The manager I spoke with mentioned he is aware of the pandemic, which validated my point YOU are aware, so what is being done for the PAYING customers who’s jobs are on line and have been docked pay FOR AN OUTAGE BEYOND OUR CONTROL! A simple email could not be made BY THE MANAGER because there is no “policy” that allows it. It’s one thing to deal with the Inconvenience of no internet, hey we can get past that, but the fact that spectrum cannot offer more than a screen shot or a three way call after such a huge disruption is unacceptable!

And I don’t watch sports when I used to watch sports that was before they begin Danielle I refuse to watch sports and I don’t think I should have to pay eight dollars a month for sports package that I don’t want to keep it shove it I say ban all pro football baseball soccer basketball games until everybody stand while the national anthem is being played.

Did you try to call consumer affairs? Please dial our 1-800 number and talk to someone  they should be able to provide with the number in your area  One more thing there is the possibility it is lost due to address label torn or ripped off during shipping and might have went to the mail recovery centerMax

5019063666	2020-08-05T16:57:24	None	istheservicedown	Over the last several months I have not had my Packages delivered on the stated date per tracking data. The updates will say they are out for delivery but then I get a message that my package was undeliverable because “the driveway or entryway was blocked or inaccessibility”. This is a lie! I have security camera video to prove there was no such “inaccessibility.” If the mail carrier doesn’t feel like delivering, then send a message for the item to be picked up! I have spoken to the Gretna post office about it, to no avail. Any suggestions?

5019067527	2020-08-05T17:00:25	None	istheservicedown	The problem is not necessarily that there is an outage. Hundreds of thousands are without power, a tropical storm just rolled through, it's to be expected. But why can't we at least hear from optimum with an estimate?!
5019068421	2020-08-05T17:01:06	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	It could be due to the lack of flights caused by this pandemic!Nothing really in most cases isn't going to arrive on timeMax

It was backed up in Wisconsin as well. The address is correct, and ironically, other items I ordered after that have been delivered quickly. Thank you for your help.
5019623299	2020-08-06T01:16:44	None	istheservicedown	There are no issues with the internet, there are no known outages in the area, everything is fine.  It is most likely the equipment.  Did all of you check your connections?  This is the answer and advice from the off-shore representative.  Again, THERE ARE NO COMCAST INTERNET ISSUES, IT IS EVERYONE'S EQUIPMENT at home.

5019629245	2020-08-06T01:23:14	pumpypumples	istheservicedown	I think you need to tell them.
5019629909	2020-08-06T01:23:56	disqus_AexR5aImVG	istheservicedown	Hey Max,Thanks for the reply.I was the receiver, not the shipper.I had no control over the box the seller sent the items in.I just paid for express mail and he did the rest.He purchased the label on pirate ship so on the label it says one day express where all the shipping info is located.When it didn’t show up after Saturday that’s when I was made aware of the package pick-up and there being no express tape on it which the front counter of any local post office I’d assume they’d apply if an express package is dropped off at the counter.Hopefully it shows up soon.I also opted to request for the package to be sent USPS as opposed to any other shipper as I wanted to support them as for my business all I use is the post office and never really had a problem.Thank you again for your reply.
5019632121	2020-08-06T01:26:22	jarminf	istheservicedown	Hi Max, I wrote to you yesterday about packages stalled for weeks at the Elk Grove Village Distribution Center. You were kind enough to provide me with a telephone number and, lo and behold, a live person answered the phone. I explained my issue and the General Clerk took down two tracking numbers, but she did not know anything more about their whereabouts than I did.I have one important question for you. When there is a 3 to 4 week backup like this, are packages eventually selected for scanning on a first-in, first out basis, or are packages randomly selected for scanning?
5019637536	2020-08-06T01:32:18	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	She did not know?It's at that facility! If it wasn't there how come?It wasn't scanned as departed?UNACCEPTABLE!!They should always process and scan the older mail first but I really don't think they do!Max

It has only gotten worse since this company took control (Spectrum). Friends, less than a mile from me have no issues, yet this is the 2nd time today that I have been without service. There are too many different forms of television and internet out there now for me to keep dealing with my service going down!! $182.00 per month for nothing but internet, and the ability to use the Spectrum TV app. On my Roku. I am shopping for somethig else!!! Tired of paying a bill like that for SUBSTANDARD SERVICE!!!!

It did this FIVE TIMES.  Of all the channels available to just randomly auto-switch to, why THAT one?SO...unable to get the TV to connect to any OTHER channel, I decide to log onto EVE Online.  I can't keep a connection with their server for more than three minutes at a time, however averaging a minute and a half.  And, some joker is claiming it's everyone's "equipment at home".  Funny, it all worked fine yesterday.  Nothing was changed or adjusted.  It doesn't work at all today.So...has COMCAST been hacked?  Would they tell us if they were?  Oh, and it's now 3:56am and STILL no reliable cable or reliable internet.  Everyone does know COMCAST has a monopoly on cable in South Florida...right?
5019879647	2020-08-06T08:00:28	None	istheservicedown	Haven’t had tv or internet in Baywood NY for 30+ hours now. Once again working from home has been halted bc optimum just can’t get it together. They charge outrageous prices yet their service never works. Even worse since Altice. Not only can I not get my work done but I have young children who think they’re being punished with no tv. It’s been a nightmare putting them down at night without tv playing in the background. As if this wasn’t bad enough, I have a handicapped mother who’s on oxygen who watches tv day/night or plays her games online bc there’s not much she CAN do, she can’t move around much. So now she’s bored being unable to play her computer games or watch tv. I understand there are far worse issues in the world but when I pay (a lot by the way, $400 p/month) for a service I expect it to work. 30+ hours is completely UNACCEPTABLE

5020482005	2020-08-06T18:11:12	madelinepearl	istheservicedown	I lost my TV service around 5pm on Tuesday. No answer from calling Optimum(just a recording). Went on to the Optimum web page and tried to chat with someone, was put on hold and never came back. I was finally able to do that again last night, and chatted for 30 minutes. I explained that the whole block was affected. I was told that the earliest day that someone would come would be August 10th. Are you kidding me? But there is a bright side. I have tv service with Optimum, but I have Internet and Landline service with Verizon Fios. I didn't lose power so I am still able to use my Internet and make phone calls. Yes, I do pay a lot more for using two different companies, but I least I still have 2 other things to rely on.

I am supposed to be working from home too. But am using sick days up until today when I went to work and asked if I could at least work in building today so as to not lose any more hours. Optimum gives no real ETA or even acknowledges their customers. I am seriously contemplating Switching to Verizon.

5020608637	2020-08-06T19:53:36	disqus_kvT5iGPYD7	istheservicedown	Hey Max,I posted on Monday about my package that hasn’t been scanned into any distribution center in Colorado — last scan was departing the post office (which a Usps employee told me is not an actual scan either).I have a ticket open, but the lady basically told me I should wait another 1-2 weeks for it to update. This package is insured and special handling was paid, yet it still hasn’t updAted in 7 days. She said there’s no way to contact the distribution center and have them look for it bc there’s thousands of packages there.  What else can I do? Any estimate on how long to wait before I file a claim? Any idea if Denver distribution is actually backed up a week+?9506 1130 0592 0212 1260 74Thanks so much!

I'm getting no update on the UPS tracking site and my freight forwarder can't give me any updates either. I'm a little concerned it's been over 2 weeks with the bulk of my stock still in transit and I can't account for where they are.Can you please help? I can provide tracking numbers, but don't want to bombard this page!Thank you!

The lady who told me it wasn’t a scan is who they got me in contact with when I put a package search request in online. Is there someone higher up I could reach like a postmaster? Or any way you have a direct number for Atlanta, GA consumer affairs? I don’t want to step on the toes of the person assigned to help, but if she didn’t even know that departed post office was an actual scan, I’m worried what else she doesn’t know! You’re the best max thank you.

I literally pay for my phone today and I still didn't any notification from them. It keeps on saying Searching for me. What can I do to fix this terrible issue? No mobile data for me in Fairfield, CT. It's all because of that storm that happened on Tuesday. Is the power back in the store because I need to have internet again? When are they going to fix the T-Mobile issue? I couldn't even make phone calls or send a text message to one of my friends. It's August 6th and it needs to get fixed.

Especially at times like these with the nation in turmoil facing a serious epidemic.  Please do your best to resolve these issues properly.  Thank you for your services.  For you internet gamer junkies more concerned for your selfish fake lives please cut these guys some slack.  I'm sure your fake lives can be rebooted... it's not like you're actually dying.  A side note to all you jerks whining about refunds... Do some freaking research and you'll find that spectrum will refund anyone who calls to ask.. They won't do it automatically if you don't bother to ask.  Thet certainly won't do it just because you flipped out and insulted them while spouting off about frivolous nonsense.   Again to the hard working PEOPLE at spectrum.. Thank you for your work.

Cutting my service with you by lunch time today if this can't be resolved coz I've been meaning to do it anyway. Too expensive but service is so so.

Hoping things perk up very soon.Crazy thing is they optimum fail to realize wifi is essential. Saves you from home invasions cuzz your cameras need wifi to work. Plus your ring doorbells, people calling us can't reach us because we can't use the phone. Very dangerous game they are playing. This is peoples lives we're talking about here. Since wifi is a necessity it should be free. Optimum gave out the free emergency wifi yet that's not on. I see optimum passpoint come up in wifi feed but not the hotspot.

5021295613	2020-08-07T11:13:19	GeckoBrothers	istheservicedown	So Comcast finally responded after being blasted on Twitter(2 days later). In a total PR boiler plate response that they apologize, and they expect return of service to be Tuesday 8/11 by 3:00am. I find it a bit fishy that's when JCP&L is going to have service restoration for the broader Lebanon area. So I guess they are too cheap to have generators backbone their system. I so look forward to Elon Musk putting Comcast out of business with Starlink.

5021369051	2020-08-07T12:43:01	jessica_corbitt	istheservicedown	I drove to Safeway at 11pm to buy a bunch of espresso drinks, so i could stay up and work graveyard shift for our international legal website. Drank the espessso at 12:30am, took care of a couple things, sat down to start working at 1am and no freaking internet. I called three times, was told 45 minute wait to speak with a technical person....three times it told me after waiting ten minutes, due to unforeseen circs, we cannot talk to you. ALL I WANTED TO KNOW IS WHEN WOULD THE INTERNET RETURN SO I COULD REFIGURE MY work NIGHT AND DAY. Now I'm a day behind, feel like crap after not being able to sleep until 4am, I'm up at 5:40 and internet is working. Since i assume this was a planned outage due them digging up the entire street downtown, which i saw on my way to Safeway, they should have let people know. The world now works on international time and many of us work from home. This is BS. Moral of the story, always check the internet before you drink a 180mg espresso drink at 1am!

It is the lack of any kind of estimated repair time or way to know if it is really my area or just my property that makes me crazy.  Spectrum won’t even discuss it until they show the area as not being impacted.Last year storm took out a tree on the property which knocked down all wires feeding the house.  Electric company came within 4 hours.  Took Spectrum 5 days and kept insisting it was an area wide problem while I was holding the cut cable in my hand!
