4848317939	2020-03-26T10:13:06	None	istheservicedown	We have been without internet since last Friday. We have been waiting patiently but it is getting ridiculous. We were told someone we come Tuesday and no one did now they are saying next Tuesday. I have two kids home from college due to this virus and all of there classes are online and they are having to go bum internet off friends and neighbors to get there assignments turned in on time. I bet the bill will be the same. Even though we are not getting a service we are paying for.

4848416186	2020-03-26T12:21:24	niki_bee	istheservicedown	Internet went down yesterday and notification I got said that it should be up by the 26th. Talking to a specialist (not affiliated with Century link), this person said that it is most likely because everyone is home and on the internet and this big load sometimes flags a DOS attack (Denial of Service). Hackers send large amount of data through the routers to clog connections. So influx of people online could of triggered an alert.

4848489004	2020-03-26T13:29:07	betty_ann_kelly	istheservicedown	Union County operates a peregrine falcon webcams that teachers and students are using for their at-home teaching. In addition, many other observers across NJ and the globe, use this web page as a distraction during COVID-19.  We are so fortunate to have these threatened species nesting on our County Courthouse since 2006 and this is nesting season.  Two eggs have been laid and folks want to follow the action from egg laying to hatching to chick rearing.  Let's hope the interruption in service is only temporary. Please let us know when service can be restored.
4848497956	2020-03-26T13:36:39	disqus_uyEPb88RIe	istheservicedown	Definitely not providing the quality of service required for this situation. Second time in total blackout this week. Im supposed to be working from home connected to my computers in the office remotely. For such an expensive service provider I would expect them to be online most of the time, or at least, let you know there is going to be "scheduled" outages in the area. What's the point of scheduling the maintenance work if we are not alerted and can prepare for it? Totally frustrating. Shame there is not any decent competitor yet.

How long will it take to fix the problem?  I understand that all companies experience problems, but I pay more than $200 each month, and I want my service.  Also, getting a canned voice that says go to channel 900 is useless when I can't select a channel.  I would like to have info on how to get a credit for service not provided.

Plus with the corona we need updates and we cannot get our news due to spectrum and they are not taking calls or updating us.  They should have a vast text message apologizing and giving us an ETA ON WHEN RESTORED.

4850510468	2020-03-27T21:07:27	None	istheservicedown	No television, telephone, or internet service in Norwalk, CT for over 2 hours! This is unconscionable any time, but now, during a crisis such as we are experiencing, this outage is intolerable-terrifying, actually. In an emergency, people cannot even call for help! Outrageous! And, there are no answers-no explanations-no predictions about when service will be restored. There is simply no one to call. Cablevision/Optimum is never held accountable for its hideous service-we suffer this nonsense all the time. We need to seek help from Hartford-we need action from State investigators and legislators to put something in place that will hold Cablevision/Optimum’s feet to the fire.

It didn't used to be this way.  We had good service until 2019 when it started to deteriorate.  It has gotten dramatically worse since January of 2020.  Calls to Verizon do little good as all we get is platitudes.  I have turned in 5 trouble ticket numbers called in by neighbors to them.  No action yet.

My phone is bouncing from 4G with one bar, to 3G with one bar, to 1X, and to simply “NO SERVICE”, all the time, throughout the day and night. I’m sure the network is flooded with so many people at home during this virus outbreak, but this has been an issue for quite some time. Simply not enough towers here to handle the traffic in normal circumstances. There is virtually no broadband service available in this city, and many rely on their phones here. Even all of the stores here have DSL at best and their systems are extremely slow all of the time.

4851643943	2020-03-28T19:25:28	None	istheservicedown	I’m extremely frustrated with Mediacom. I called last week to discontinue my Cable TV service and they want to charge me a $50 fee to keep Internet. I talked to a supervisor and apparently they prefer to lose a customer than to waive this fee. To top off, the Internet has been slow and intermittent for the past few days. Fortunately, AT&T will be installing fiber optic Internet in a few days. Then I plan to cancel Mediacom altogether. The way I see it, Mediacom will not improve their service and support unless they start losing business to their competition. I hope more Mediacom customers opt to cut the cord and say bye to Mediacom.

4854321507	2020-03-30T21:00:43	disqus_qoDUfpEGzH	istheservicedown	Me too in Ashland City, TN 37015, everyday it’s like this. I don’t know how I would be able to work today from home on 1 by 34 Mbit when I pay for up to 1000 which usually gets at least 940 by 25 Mbit. Thank god, I took off today for illness or I would of anyway due to internet. They are doing a harsh rate limiting QOS since the ingress is much better than usual and the egress is doing an aggressive download limit. Unfortunately, Charter is the only choice for high speed internet in Ashland City, TN. They have a monopoly on the infrastructure and we are stuck with a company that doesn’t care about their customers that will most likely get a large bailout from the Cares Package. How about they at least put out a notice like all the other big companies have about c-19 and let us know what heck is going on.

Everyone needs to call them and tell them you want a major discount. Maybe they will get there ass in gear and fix these Nodes that have been down for months.       Johnny

They said there was a outage in my area nope all the neighbors are fine asked them. Than tried to tell me the outage was 2 counties away from me which is a hour away. if I'm the only one having the issues and now at 8 pm you figure this out now your schudule someone to come out at 8 am the next day. When they could have had a tech out from 1 to 3 the same day but again the supervisor was in another country and was to dumb to figure it out to put a ticket in 7 reps later I finally get a rep to come out next day now a service I pay in full not late. 3 different boxs 3 different rooms are not working but the tv and other things in those outlets work. My internet works and my phone the cable boxes dont work makes no sense. When this virus is over switch services they are the worse service to have.

Optimum is not doing nothing to fix the internet services. They have a lot of money and they should be able to buy servers but they don't. They don't even help with the situation. When going onto the website they just say COVID-19 we get that there is an outbreak but we have many people that are stuck in their houses until further notice. I can't even stream, play music, and talk to friends on a social media app at the same time anymore. Once we had to stay in our houses internet started getting slower and slower. And they don't even let us contact customer support or contact them via chat. Why am I paying for something and not getting what I ordered. Why am I getting slower than before.

4858062946	2020-04-02T15:34:19	annettritter	istheservicedown	I have a package that was shipped 2nd day air on the 26th. It shows a departure scan from the final destination - Anchorage - on the 29th, then all of the sudden, on the 30th, it says "a required security check delayed delivery." No reason for a security check, it's just a package from Amazon. However, everyday since then it has been saying that "Your package has been delayed due to events beyond our control. We're adjusting delivery plans as quickly as possible." This has happened to every package that Amazon has sent through UPS for the last several months. It has been taking about 2 weeks for packages to get from Anchorage to Juneau! I have no trouble getting packages on time from either USPS or FedEx on time, only UPS. If this was a "global health crisis problem" I wouldn't be upset, but as I said, this has been a problem for months.

4858906698	2020-04-03T04:06:44	None	istheservicedown	I did some snooping around and have heard that one of the local postmen suffered a COVID-related death. And more generally USPS employees aren’t able to get masks, gloves, or wipes to help diminish the risk of getting the virus.  Given the death and the worsening circumstances, the surrounding offices are shook up and deliveries to our area have apparently been suspended for an undisclosed amount of time. Still no public acknowledgement of this, but local government officials for 10463 are aware and have promised (on Twitter) to get to the bottom of the situation.  Let’s all hope the USPS employees get the supplies they need soon, so the rest of us can get what we need too.

Some sites give an immediate failure message on the homepage and then no access at all to the rest of the site. It's a mess and all of my websites on one server and access to the control panel all fail.  I've spent nearly 8 hours on hold. The one time I did get through at 2:00 in the AM, I finally got a nice lady who spent 45 minutes with me and could not determine what was wrong or how to fix anything. Her only suggestion was that I upgrade all my sites to another GoDaddy hosting offering for a total cost of about $1500. I told her that I had just paid over $200 to keep my existing GoDaddy sites up and running for another year. When I asked her why we couldn't just fix what was wrong and leave my sites as they were. She hung up on me. Have not been able to talk to anyone else at GoDaddy! since then after nearly 20 tries. Just "please hold on" and then their awful music or silence. This is what I get on all of my websites when I try to login my website's update and control page:"Warning: require_once(/home/content/06/6970206/html/johnhoyle/wp-content/plugins/wp-backitup//lib/includes/class-admin-bar.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/content/06/6970206/html/johnhoyle/wp-content/plugins/wp-backitup/lib/includes/class-wpbackitup-admin.php on line 565"Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required '/home/content/06/6970206/html/johnhoyle/wp-content/plugins/wp-backitup//lib/includes/class-admin-bar.php' (include_path='.:/usr/local/php5_6/lib/php') in /home/content/06/6970206/html/johnhoyle/wp-content/plugins/wp-backitup/lib/includes/class-wpbackitup-admin.php on line 565The site is experiencing technical difficulties.

Cannot get an answer online or via phone on when this terrible service will finally be fixed. When I can get a bar, I stay on hold for 45+ minutes to talk to customer service. They of course tell me the connection is bad (obviously, that is why I'm calling) and inevitably hang up on me. No better luck online. You would think that a company this large would do a better job, especially when most of the country is quarantined at home. Cell service is the only way to communicate. 3 days of this is ridiculous.

Schools are virtual but no reliable access is a major issue.  AT&T needs to provide discounts or free service to customers for each day of unreliable internet.  This will cost them but will retain their customer base.  If not we will seek it from providers who are reliable.

4864779450	2020-04-07T16:07:02	disqus_7JwiU8DmUC	istheservicedown	I had one package on April 3 that said it was delivered.  It wasn't. I've been home. No one came to my door. I was tracking it online and they were nowhere near me and then I received a message saying it was delivered.  The shipper resent my order for free and it was supposed to be delivered today, April 7. Again I'm home. Logged in and it says my package is scheduled for delivery today by 8pm. It showed it was still at the facility.  Never showed out for delivery.  I'm checking every 15 minutes or so, then I get a text from fedex that says delivery rescheduled for April 21! I go to their website and it says delivery attempted and then shows future delivery requested.  I didn't request anything and no delivery attempt was made. I called them and was told the delivery date was changed until April 21 because of the covid 19 virus.  I asked why doesn't the message online say that instead of delivery attempted.  She said the website is being updated. That was over an hour ago now and all FedEx shows is that they are delivering. The rep said there is a delay in all packages because of the virus.  Not sure if this is just for Georgia or if it applies everywhere. It's a mess and I hope they update their site. I told the rep that they are going to be bombarded with calls if they say there was a delivery attempt,  or it says delivered and it wasn't.  I should have just requested my package be delivered by the post office.  They are still getting my packages to me on time for now. This is the 2nd fedex package to be delivered and now this. I'll probably never get it. I think I'll request it be delivered to one of their stores near me and will first check if they are open.

Ordered a package from Singapore that, as of March 16th, tracking says "processed through sort facility Singapore".  I've ordered from them numerous times before with 7 to 10 day delivery times.  I realise there are obvious delays, but I don't even know if it's still in Singapore, on it's way but not being scanned, or sitting in line at some post office waiting it's turn.  Any thoughts with your experience?  The tracking is LT106013138SG.  Thanks.

4866128934	2020-04-08T14:55:27	disqus_46Od1WVF5D	istheservicedown	I was supposed to have a food delivery service package delivered on Monday, April 6, 2020 in Philadelphia.  The company created a label and on Fedex's end it is still sitting in the same status as label created as of Monday when it was supposed to be delivered.  As I stated this is a perishable item from a food delivery service and cannot be sitting with Fed ex somewhere as this is not safe.  Also, I rely on this food being delivered so I don't have to go out in order to practice social distancing.  Fed ex cannot just have perishable food sitting somewhere.  Today is 2 days later and I still have not received the package, which means it is still sitting somewhere.  I am supposed to have food delivered each week and this is the second week this has happened.  This service is expensive and by the time I get the package, if I ever get the package, I may have to just throw it away because of fed ex just letting it sit somewhere, which means money just thrown in the trash.  This is unacceptable and I am going to request that the food delivery company that I use no longer use Fed ex but perhaps go with another service perhaps UPS.  I understand that we are experiencing delays because of the pandemic but perishable food cannot be delayed 2 days and longer.

4867336453	2020-04-09T11:35:19	maryannreneegrabowski	istheservicedown	Having little to no service is this is entering day 3. I'm in Ohio. Some people that was having this issue says they seem to be okay. But I feel their is a tower down around my house. I did everything that they say to do I even called and they couldn't tell me what's going on. I know the fact it isn't my phone because I get full service on the other side of the city with no issue whatsoever. And if it was anything with my phone I wouldn't get service nowhere. So I don't understand why we keep having this and to be honest this is a waste of my money. So how long do I have to wait to have my service back?? $60 isn't worth this.

4869759859	2020-04-11T02:33:29	disqus_MmHEhrZC23	istheservicedown	I'm ready for Cox to come up with an explanation for the outage today, April 10 in West Phoenix. Earlier in the day they reported on their phone app that it would be fixed at 5:29 pm. It was down and out most of the day, then came back at a much-throttled slower speed later in the afternoon. Then, at 5:29 right on the dot it came back up to speed.Now, I absolutely do not believe in coincidences. Until I hear differently I'm going to believe that Cox is performing rolling outages to alleviate bandwidth over-usage by all of the work-at-homers and Netflix watchers who are home because of the virus panic.5:29 on the dot? Come on!To make matters worse, Verizon chose today to upgrade its cell phone towers in Phoenix for 5G, so cell phone calling was out too. We didn't have the option to use wifi-calling because, guess what, Internet was down.My wife and I are both working at home, and I'm going to be VERY unhappy if these outages continue and we lose our jobs.

4870141674	2020-04-11T12:40:13	None	istheservicedown	This is absurd. At a time of pandemic stay-at-home orders and mandated online teaching and schooling, not only has Spectrum not fixed this problem in 34 hrs and counting, but provides no explanation of what went wrong, what the status of repair is, or an estimated time for service to resume.This is why we need more options for Internet service providers in Maine, but also why Internet needs to be treated like a utility. It needs to be regulated as a utility, made available to everyone, and be far more affordable. Comcast jacked my rates up to near $80 a month because they’re the only game in town, then they don’t even provide reliable service or updates. Maine needs to break up their monopoly in many areas and regulate them more closely.

It is currently in transit to the next facility.  I just got that message.  It also says delivery date unknown.  Is this bad?  I heard it's an autogenerated message when a package hasn't been scanned in 24 hours.  I'm getting nervous that it's lost.

Then no tracking at all on Sunday.  Can you explain to me why it's taking longer because a lack of employees?  It's not even two day shipping really, it's you get it when you get it.  Why did the sender even pay for two day shipping when it could have been three?  Why isn't USPS being more transparent.  It doesn't even say arrived at Denver Distribution Center or even left from there.  Someone is dropping the ball big time.

It is a standard envelope with clear addressing. Invaluable contents within this letter. Please help! Looking for more information. Are the Wellesley/Boston mail services very backed up?

4875032940	2020-04-14T21:31:09	disqus_Jix8KTp5dD	istheservicedown	Hi Max,I just got off the phone with the Evergreen, Colorado post office. Right now the Denver Distribution Center only has 30% of it's normal workforce. The male employee said he mailed 1st class mail out to Missouri and it took 2 weeks. Then he mailed a package for 2 day and it came in 10 days after the expected delivery date. The Denver Distribution Center, I assume, has a back log of 3-4 days, maybe even more! Seeing how that's a huge hub for mail and they are down to 30% of employees, I personally don't think it would be possible to send packages out to pre-covid19 standards. It says even on the USPS website that to not consider it lost until after 15 days, and then to file a claim then. This seems to be an ongoing trend right now. The employee at Evergreen said for me to call back next Tuesday, if I don't get the package, which will be the 21st of April 2020.

Do you happen to know if you guys are prioritizing things until May as many others are doing to make sure those who needs medications and things important get them? Mine is just media mail so I would assume this would not be on the high priority list which is fine. I am also assuming with the depleted work force there is quite the backlog as well. The build up of numerous issues would make this a nightmare and I truly thank you and others from the bottom of my heart that you take the time to reply on here and continue to risk your health during these tricky times.Dave

This has been going on before the COVID19 health crisis.  I have called them at least 20 times.  Many times after being on hold, they disconnect me.  When and if I get a real person, all they say is that they want to teach me how to reboot my cable modem.  I am a computer technician and find that their equipment and service is terrible. They read from a script. I can not work from home. I can not use the internet/Wifi.  The signal is so inconsistent.  I have asked for a Cablevision tech to check the connection at the pole.  They tell me that they will monitor my signal for 24 hours and they will can me at a specified time to give me the results.  They never called.  I called them after numerous attempt and they didn't know what I was talking about.This company should be ashamed of themselves.  Their customer support is worthless and they service is even worse.   I think that we as customers should write to the politicians to get a new cable company in our area that we provide the proper support, quality equipment and support service.Optimum is quick to charge for their terrible service.  I found that while many of us were complaining about their service, the company was advertising on TV how wonderful their connection was and to top it off, emails were being sent for us to go paperless.  Paperless means that they just take your money quickly and quietly to avoid any customer complaints.  What a company!!!!!!!!!

One is from Florida, another San Francisco, and another one from North Carolina. All of them only say they departed the facility they came from and then nothing but “in transit to next facility”. The tracking of the package i am most concerned about is: 9405511899562593624502 This was supposed to be delivered Saturday and has been “in transit” since Sunday with no updates since. I’ve called USPS about it and they are investigating. I’m wondering what the issue is, I’m aware facilities are short staffed but this package is time sensitive. Any help would be appreciated.

I tried calling both of those numbers the 60611 doesn't answer the other number is disconnected.I checked my USPS account and Ebay there's no change still in the where about of the package. There's no one to talk to to get some results. This extremely hard waiting. If I knew where it was it would be cool. I guess I have to be patient. It's a large item as well shipped by Parcel Select, I would have never chosen this method of shipping for this particular item.None of my other things I've ordered have been delayed like this, most have moved thru the USPS system with no problem.

There's no help or any type of communication from USPS at all. I also can't file a claim because the sender didn't insure the package. If there's no change by Monday April 20 I will just ask for a refund from Ebay. Tracking Number 9461208205496171068858 is associated with a currently open case.

Shippers should know that their parcels will not be arriving within delivery estimates. When you go on the USPS website it says everything is running on time with only few incidences of minor delays which is clearly not the case given this thread.

If they can update/change a date and time like that Then they could just as easily post an explanation like...WE ARE BACKED UP BE PATIENT or something. I would rather they acknowledge it in some way than let us hang out to dry like this. Trying to keep the economy going with my little Ebay sales. Have proof that it left my PO but what now?

4878189392	2020-04-17T01:28:16	None	istheservicedown	Your previous messageHi, I managed to speak with two postal workers/clerks, one from Fort Dearborn at 540 N. Michigan, the other from the place you shipped it. They said that the package went to Downtown Main PO at 433 W Harrison and from there it should go to Bedford Park South Suburban then to Park Forest to me.They both said that whoever took it from where you shipped it should have scanned it at the location it was taken to or the receiving processing should have scanned it in. He said the processing hubs are operating on a short staff and it's probably sitting in a bin waiting to be moved. The clerk where you shipped it told me to call back on Monday. I was told by Fort Dearborn we can get the shipping cost refunded because they are late sending the package.Ebay contacted me and said that I have 30 days from the shipping date before I can get help with getting a refund with them. I don't want to do that, I prefer to get the keyboard. So right now the package is either downtown Chicago or at Bedford Park, they said that those places would not allow me to go there. They both said the 500 postal workers have contracted the virus and 19 have died in the Chicago area.Tracking 9461208205496171068858

Now I've had someone pay me today, and I then made a $200 deposit trying to understand why my $500 transfer just sat pending. I now have $700 pending and as if it's completely unavailable for use. I had bills due by midnight. It is now after 1 am. I should be able to access my money and it post almost instantly. It always has! I can't access my money and my deposits just sit pending, not added to my balance or available for my past due bills. The PLS cashier who did my $200 PayPal deposit showed me the transfer was successful on her end. So was my employers. However nothing is available on my end. The $500 deposited today at 3:30pm EST. And the $200 deposited at 8:21pm EST tonight. Now, as of 1:16am still no change! I have not had this issue in the seven years I've had this account. I am very upset about this. Anyone else with this issue?? I am lost as to what to do. I can't get anyone on the phone for PayPal until Monday it appears??

You can barley understand the rep. They have you repeat steps over and over. They try to get a tech to your home to charge u 70 dollars knowing the issue is outside. Im paying 133 for unlimited 1000 speed but never gotten close to it only 177 mbps. I get a bill for 200 overage usage but how when its unlimited. They said i had 250 mbps which is 133 a month but if unlimited 1000 mbps is 133 why am i being over charged 200? Been without service for 24 hours. Made an appointment but then get a text saying the issie was resolves cancel. Lol. My internet still is off. Wow att is looking like they may have a new customer. Ive been with Comcast for 15 yrs only because they cornered the market. That's why they provide shitty service.

4880439787	2020-04-18T19:37:20	None	istheservicedown	Hi I am having a similar issues with a package that my sister sent she  dropped boxed it late friday from Kissimmee, FL 4/11 to Secaucus, Nj. She normally doesn't have any issues. However, this tracking just keep stating Your package is moving within the USPS network. On 4/13 I checked it and stated arriving 4/14 after 6pm. Then 4/14 came and the tracking then stated delayed however, your package should arrive before 8pm. The next day it went back to stating In transit to it's next facility. I filed a claim and had the post office in secaucus, Nj call me stating they haven't actually received it and that it may be a distributing post office disruption. Please any advise or help greatly appreciate 9510806601960101178083

At this point would it not be reasonable for the a USPS to contact this vendor or to file a fraud alert?

4880928219	2020-04-19T05:47:43	disqus_Xb3BAim5eK	istheservicedown	Hi Max,Just to update,  the local usps in NJ , kendall park area contacted the receiver yesterday, and advised that the shipment is still being held at customs, and should be delivered next week. The tracking is CX649193784CA.But as you can see in the tracking description, it showed that customs released the shipment on April 3rd and departed San Fransisco the same day.Sounds fishy. Does the local PO have information that we can't see ? Or they just trying to stall time and blaming customs for delays ? I don't want to jump to conclusions or assumptions, but just want to clarify why they would state our shipment is still held in customs, when the tracking info clearly shows it departed customs 2 weeks ago. Thanks again Max.

I was watching in normal HD one night on my 4K set (also east northport, NY), and suddenly the picture went wide, and everyone on screen gained 20 pounds.  Didn't touch a thing.  I've rebooted the cable box and the set, and spent way too much time in my TV's documentation and Optimum's (more like Minimum's?,) documentation, trying to find a switch to throw.  "480p SD" is all I get; nothing gives me HD; only Zoom width gives the right aspect ratio, but all the edges are offscreen.

All they have to do is take phone numbers and emails from customer, hire someone to work from home and respond to us and resolve issues. It is wrong to have there Company  active right now if no wa6 to reach them except online with an account. I never signed up , so don’t have an account, but have a charge from PayPal saying the merchant I orderEd from is Engelsoto llc. The actual onl8ne company was topmattres. Think PayPal is stealin* from everyone right now.

Seller said it's in the USA and to ask USPS about delivery status.  When I check USPS site it says it was picked-up by shipping partner in Brooklyn NY, on 4-8-20, USPS is waiting for the item. The "shipping partner" is Newgistics, and their tracking site just says on 4-8-20 it received shipping info and created shipping label, that's it.  Any ideas on where it's at?

4884233107	2020-04-21T18:03:02	disqus_UB9aAu4WCP	istheservicedown	You are absolutely correct and I should have known better since decades ago I worked for OPM or the federal Office of Personnel Management. After President Garfield's assassination in 1881 by a disgruntled job seeker under the corrupt spoils system the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883 establishing the federal merit system that forbade payola.I will be more than happy to write such a letter for you.  I am now completing a survey sent to me by the USPS. They managed to find a package that I thought was lost for nearly two weeks; within a few days tracking was updated and I should receive the package this afternoon (package is in town and Out for Delivery).  I planned to feature you and your actions in my evaluation.  If you send me your email or home address I'll send you a copy of both my survey responses and the letter to your supervisor.

4885219366	2020-04-22T13:17:06	disqus_WVlnsFuAiP	istheservicedown	Clayton, NC, service for my cell phone is down again. I have been having issues for the past few days. The signal strength is only one bar when it is up. I was on hold with the Unemployment Office this morning and then POOF....I lost signal and got disconnected. This phone is my lively hood. The length of this outage is unacceptable. I hope AT&T issues refunds on Monthly charges. Time is money to me.
4885253280	2020-04-22T13:45:48	taylorbal	istheservicedown	I believe that my internet service is being “throttled” in order to free up bandwidth for others. My internet service goes down EVERY SINGLE DAY generally between 1pm-5 pm but it could happen at any given time. It’s not just once a day. It could happen anywhere from 3-5 times a day. With many people working from home now it’s possible Optimum may need to throttle some connections in order to provide high speeds to the rest of their customers. After doing some research I found out that throttling is legal, however the company is obligated to inform the customer. Since running a Speed test is not enough, a friend of mine who is a professional IT consultant is going to run some tests for me and he will know for sure whether or not my service is being throttled. It may be legal, but I can guarantee that if I can prove throttling, I will seek reimbursement since Optimum doesn’t specifically have a policy regarding throttling.

4885469084	2020-04-22T16:24:19	spencer_newton	istheservicedown	Hey. I am a collector of Winnie the Pooh, My Little Pony, and Care Bears items, and I had this awesome Pooh Bear fire engine that a child could sit on and ride that blows bubbles sent from a woman on Letgo (who was nice enough to make an exception to send it) in Parsippany and it was sent a week ago today with Priority Mail. The status says "In Transit To Next Facilty" and has since it arrived in Newark Sunday. This also happened when I sent her the money order for the toy, and it apparently set at Newark for 11 days. That too was sent Priority Mail.Now, since the item in question is indeed one of those ride on cars by Kiddieland, the box is huge (She sent me photos), so I'm not concerned about it being lost because they can't miss it. I called USPS this morning to open a case, and when I did the same for the money order, they found it and delivered it. I also know NJ is dealing with COVID 19, but the woman on the phone at USPS said that's still no excuse for it not to have been here by now, as Priority Mail is only supposed to be 2 to 3 business days. Tracking number is 9505514858360106447869. Destination is Cairo IL.

I have been overpaying for their crappy service for two decades now. My internet bill is almost $80!! For 4Mbps??!! This is total robbery, YES, class suit should be filed. Give me my $$$ back for all these years, you obsolete Windstream. Not even a line of text, explaining what is going on! I wish I can tell them to shove it where sun doesn’t shine(:!😡😡😡

The company is an Asian company and only some sections have a translator to translate to English.  I did not understand the language except when it said Customer Service.  I clicked on Customer service, but the only thing I recognized was there was a section to input your problem and their was two button options so I sent the same message twice each time pushing pushing one button then the other.  I don't  know if they got my message, but the next day my package started moving.  Thank you for your help!Cassandra H

How can two high value parcels be posted in LA, get to the distribution centre and disappear without trace?  The one before that has been "stuck" in LA since 18th March!  I guess they're not stuck at all, they are missing without trace!  Geez, if this is USPS Priority international (for which we pay a hell of a lot), they can keep it!  What a scam!  Strangely, parcels from Greenboro NC are managing to make it through the system and across the atlantic with no trouble at all....

4886943071	2020-04-23T17:30:38	Shell913	istheservicedown	I'm seriously thinking about it to. There just becoming a joke anymore. They need to give us what we pay for or start only making us pay for what MBPS that were getting for the month because I'm not going to keep paying $69.99 a month for 30 MBPS I I'm pretty sure AT&T has way better deals then that plus they have a direct line as well. I'm suppose to be getting 200 MBPS download but I'm only getting anywhere from 16 kb to maybe 20/30 MBPS download. I'm getting so sick of this they shouldn't be able to keep doing this to people something really needs to be done.
4886944522	2020-04-23T17:31:37	mariacolyerhorton	istheservicedown	Two shipments, 2 completely different orders. One of these orders they have had at our local fedex location for 10 days. Each day saying it's on the truck for delivery by the end of the day. The other one even showed "Delivered" for a day and now is back to pending. Customer service is useless. They made a "claim" and said a supervisor from the Hampton facility was supposed to call me.....crickets. Someone is going to give me my money back and unfortunately it will have to be the vendor we bought from. Everyone, we need to form something together and get some attention here. Are they stilling our stuff? Are they just not working over there? Do they load their truck up and come back to the plant with it still half full? What the hell? Who's in charge over there? I have called and called and called. No actions are being taken. No questions answered. Nothing. One of my deliveries were plants so fedex will pay for them because they are surely dead.

4887792627	2020-04-24T08:09:19	None	istheservicedown	in venice - have the best plan with spectrum. housemates and i are now considering leaving. running 2 servers and two creatives video and photo workstations, plus movies when we’re not working. was out for 30 minutes now back thankfully. agreeing with everyone, a company like this shouldn’t be having issues for a full 24 hours even in specific areas they aren’t reporting. hopefully this will end quickly otherwise i don’t see spectrum being the second largest company offering internet in the us for too much longer i would imagine, wifi being so essential now it’s crazy to think they can’t even send text updates or even let us know what’s going on SOMEHOW. Lost the respect i had for their overall pretty good speed, even though it never gets as good as what’s advertised, also disappointing but i thought that was due to the amount we use it and how many people use it, even though we have 5 routers/extensions for 6 people. GET ON IT SPECTRUM, pay your people overtime (what they’re prob actually worth anyways) and get your problems figured out when people need you most, otherwise what the fuck is the point of spending so much a month if this is what we get in return. thanks but no thanks.

The only way I know this is an outage is because I have the Smart Home Manager app. I also downloaded the myAT&T app and was able to chat with a human by clicking "Support," then scrolling to the bottom to click "Call us or chat with us online," then when it said "It's taking longer than normal to reach us...," clicking "My Internet," scrolling until I saw "Prefer to chat?" Once the "Chat" button appeared, I clicked on it and wrote "Human specialist" and was able to get in contact with a person eventually. They told me it would be 18 hours from 8 am 4/24/20, which means 4 am 4/25/20. They said they had to get permission from authorities to have a team of 4 work together on the repair due to the pandemic. Don't know the accuracy of all of that, but it was helpful to at least have some information. I didn't find out if it was weather related or not, but my assumption is that it's lightning or power line down because it happened during the rain yesterday.

4889099756	2020-04-25T05:17:22	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Julia no one is really stealing!I always tell my customers to put your address in the package about four times tape with packing tape to the item and even write all around the box This way if it does get lost the Facility it's in can send it back to you if the package is open or the mail recovery center in Atlanta will send it back to you. They only auction items off on govdeals if they can't return it to the sender I hope this helps clear things up And other thing i see a lot why items come loose because they are not packed properly! I would put a lot of packing tape around where it seals so it wont come open   Thanks!Max

4889144027	2020-04-25T06:46:12	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	Julia no offense taken!  I have seen so many birthday cards with money in themripped open but not by employees but by high speed automation machines!I wouldn't recommend putting money in any card unless it's put into a padded envelope and sealed well with packing tape Believe me it breaks my heart when the card gets separated from the envelope and i can't return it! One thing a lot of customers don't know and i have a paper of what you can't put into an envelope. I have thousand s of car keys remotes flash drives jewelry and other valuable items The key to remember is anything that is a 1/4 " in a envelope has  good chance of being ripped open when the machine jamsIf you like i can send you a paper explaining and i would tell everyone you knowyou can send me your address to my government email and i will replyMy email is max.j.stock@usps.govMax
4889152705	2020-04-25T07:04:18	disqus_5ggcJb3Ht5	istheservicedown	I am here to help people not to argue!If you were an employee you would see what i mean! For one thing we have cameras all over the facility and if you are caught stealing you will be fired and blackballed! No i am not the token representative like i said i am here to HELP people! I am doing this on MY OWN TIME!! because i CARE!! I can't speak for anyone but myself! So if you have a gripe don't take it out on me!Thank you!Max

Im use AT&T Mobility you never knownwhat is in the phone that effects the service you get. Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY Github D3 Data Analytics MALICIOUS LINK I was curious about the D3json code, when I clicked on the link AT&T Mobility App WARNED me but left the decisusion to use the link up to me. The 5g change is not going to be without its moments of no service as towers and stations are equiped to handle the increased use and traffic be patient not all the people in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA are at home and AT&T is dedicated to bringing all of her clients and their many varied phone, tablets, computers and TV 5g to people who have never been able to have phone service, TV service or the Internet in a world full of places and people that without AT&T 5g we would never know about or see.

There are  HUNDREDS upon HUNDREDS, maybe thousands of people being SCREWED right now, who desperately need their mail and YOU are all USPS can come up with? What kind of unprofessional bull**** is this? Why are YOU martyr for USPS now? WE can ALL look up our tracking# which is all you're doing anyway. Don't you dare throw  hurt feelings in my face. I'm an STNA and I was ALWAYS expected to do my job without feeling sorry for myself. USPS needs to fix this problem and relieve you of your burden to save the world.

4889415461	2020-04-25T13:54:20	None	istheservicedown	Preshipment just means the package wasnt scanned. So it could be shipped and not scanned or not scanned yet to ship. Either way international items give them some time as their time zones differ too

The postal office at 02215 is closed and one official i managed to call up told me that the postal office at Astor (02115). I did a quick search and found out the phone you gave me is a sorting center in 02215. Do you think they still allow pick up as it is not a real postal office center?

Item was "picked up" on April 20th from Saint Charles Illinois, then 6 days later, on the 26th it arrived at Elk Grove Distribution Illinois (which is only 30 min away from Saint Charles). How could it have taken 6 days for a short amount of distance? Delivery date was April 23 for NY, now it's stuck at Elk Grove. I'm a little worried.

4890820186	2020-04-26T17:54:59	garydeboer	istheservicedown	In Seattle, I am paying for 75mB DOWN AND 25 uP SERVICE AND BARELY GETTING 6 DOWN AND 1.5 UP!  This is crap!  And its been this way for months.  They can't BS their way of saying the area is under heavy unplanned usage (due to stay at home).  They are throttling the services!  All in an attempt to  sale bigger packages!  Where is the consumer  protection?  Like any utility, they should be required to expose all of their data.  This is corporate welfare by ensuring they have a monopoly and guaranteeing they make a profit.  Why not have the PUC change the billing practice to have us pay for what we use?  Not a BS package that states something like average up/download speeds when most of us never get that!  And BTW, average means I should be getting higher speeds which I never have seen.If we paid for what we used, they would be forced to improve their deliver and as well as be proactive and engaged to make sure everyone is getting what they need (and willing to pay).  !!!

4891161013	2020-04-26T23:30:01	disqus_OSSA1i0gma	istheservicedown	Anyone else experiencing a month+ delay? I have a package shipped out on the 23’d of March and hasn’t been scanned in from Brooklyn.

Weeks later I purchased something else based out of Brooklyn and made it to California in a week. Any hope?Here’s the tracking number: 9405510202079043053643

4892926110	2020-04-28T10:36:54	disqus_PyZMQm9lvm	istheservicedown	Hello, I purchased an item that was shipped from North Dakota on 20 April 2020. Tracking number 9405803699300763030832. Says it arrived on 24 April at the Des Moines, IA  Distirbution Center. Had an item sit there for over 2 weeks last year and then was finally delivered. Hoping that is not the same thing again. I know with the Pandemic, I need to be patient. The "In Transit" service message really does not help. Wondering why no one scans it  to say "departed" the facility and where it may be? The person who mailed this package mailed another package the same day bound for Maryland. It arrived as indicated on 23 April. My package was to be delivered the same day. I get a message on 23 April saying it would be delayed. Then it arrived to Des Moines, IA at the distribution Center. I mailed a package to Cheyanne, WY and it arrived a day early. Not saying things don't happen especially during a Pandemic. But I am seeing USPS operating as normal in other areas. Can you help?

There is no explanation as to why. Appears to be stuck there with no movement whatsoever. I am tempted to cancel my order and reorder it. How long does someone wait on UPS before taking other action. UPS is unresponsive. Theoretically, my package may never arrive. My postal code is 10965.

From there it went to Kansas where it seems to be a blackhole... it has been to 3 cities and it still hasn't left Kansas (been there for 2 days). I've been tracking it since it left Ontario, California. I'm wondering if my package is hitchhiking and sightseeing before it finally gets here to me in South Bend, Indiana? FedEx sucks right now!!!! I've never had problems with the USPS or UPS. It will be over two weeks before it gets here...but they'll probably blame it on the Coronavirus...

Having said that, my internet is also down and I can’t do my job from home. This sucks, but hasn’t happened more than a couple times in two years, so you won’t hear me saying that spectrum is pathetic or doesn’t care. That’s just whining.

When I call, I can't be heard or I break-up, but can hear the person on the other end clearly.  Half the time I can't hear the phone dial.

4893557366	2020-04-28T19:39:21	rayferraro	istheservicedown	Does anyone know what’s happening with New York ISC and international packages? I have a regular package from Sourh Korea almost two months late and an EMs which is supposed to take 3 days to arrive still in Korea after two weeks. 17track says the packages are with the air carriers but my seller in Korea tells me New York is simply not allowing mail to be delivered into the US and they do not have permission to leave. Will it be this way for months until NY reopens? My tracking numbers by the way are EB022299445KR and LK065899455KR

4893669172	2020-04-28T21:10:39	disqus_PyZMQm9lvm	istheservicedown	I have a package that was sent on 23 March from Germany. They sent me a USPS tracking number but all that says is Origin Post is Preparing Shipment. I assume that is because it has not hit the U.S. yet. The sender checked on his end and the package was to leave France by mail on the 13th of April. Still nothing. I called the Post Office on an issue with another package and they told me that as of 23 March 2020, all International incoming packages have been suspended because of the Corona Virus. That is what I was told. Anyone else been getting packages from overseas? My package still says Origin Post is Preparing Shipment as of today. It has been over a month.

4893688270	2020-04-28T21:26:56	rayferraro	istheservicedown	What’s frustrating I think is that there is no real consistent information from USPS as to what is going on. That’s the first I heard of the march 23 suspension and it makes sense but what doesn’t make sense is that I had a package coming from Russia, dropped off on the 31st of March, it sat there until the 23rd of April, and arrived in NY on the 25th and is now sluggishly making its way through the USPS system domestically. The aforementioned packages from Korea, two other customers in the Us had it sent the same day. One in LA and he got it a week after it was sent. One in Texas got it three days after it was sent. I don’t understand why some countries and states are getting delayed and not others.

I lowered my package to 400/400 considering I wasn't getting anywhere close to what I was paying for.  The problem still persisted; the problem continued to get worse and was only able to achieve around 20-25mbps.  I talked to a rep previously and she said I would need a gpon because my bpon wouldn't support the faster speeds. I started having problems about 2 days later and talked to another tech and they said I should be fine.  Now i'm having next to 0 performance download and upload.   -Rosedale MD

While on the phone, I asked about my other package. It was supposed to have been flying out of France on the 13th of April. I have been patiently waiting knowing there is a Pandemic going on. The tracking number I was given for that package is RS109975206LT. It has said "pre-Shipment " since I received that package and assume that it will only show up when it gets to the U.S. But with no updates since then, I thought I would ask.

There is no departure scan from them!In transit really doesn't mean it went to the next  facility!I have seen packages that say that and they are still in the facility!Don't know why they can't find it! Like i said there is no departure scan from them You can tell them i work in the nixie and rewrap unit and i do a lot of packages research in my facility two packages with no departure scan? unacceptable! Scanning plays a major role in our operations!Max

Packages seem to sit in limbo there for several days at a time. It is crazy, because when we get packages thru another state they do not sit in Limbo. This is my how we order since the epidemic. We know for a fact that postal service workers get paid really well. They need to step up and do their job.

It has nothing to do with china infecting the world either, they just suck and are literal thieves guilty of breach of contract for not providing the service they promise.

4894755543	2020-04-29T17:56:17	disqus_PyZMQm9lvm	istheservicedown	Appreciate it Max. Glad someone at least looking into some of this mess. Totally get it. With everyone shopping from home now plus some USPS employees out sick because of the fear of Corona (or they actually have it), things have gotten backed up. My only issue is I feel like their should be a departure scan and not just "in transit". I can only imagine the madness the USPS employees are dealing with, but a package should have an arrival and departure. When my package left Fargo, no departure scan. It just showed up at the Des Moines Distribution Center "in Transit."Maybe I am missing something here as I don't know the procedures but I found a OIG Management Advisory: Des Moines, IA Network Distribution Center Operations from 2015 outlining a crap load of failures on the employees. Just my 2 cents. I guess I will continue to wait like everyone else.

It was packed and taped for it to travel. I can't believe it can just disappear. Hopefully there might be an answer for me and the buyer of the item. Dominic
4895701118	2020-04-30T12:11:21	disqus_PyZMQm9lvm	istheservicedown	Max, that is what I learned through this process. Maybe USPS thought customers would be happy to see something updated but it is very ambiguous. Tells me nothing. My "in transit" stopped a days ago. No updates yesterday. Wonder what that means. probably nothing at this point. Guess I will wait  a week longer then start a claim. Thanks for the help.

When I talked to customer service when using WiFi calling, they told me it had something to do with the Tower in Chicago and they couldn't tell me when I would get service. So they gave me a $10.00. When I talked to someone through facebook messenger they told me "Taking a look at the area, I do see that our engineers are working to address an issue with the local site which is impacting all T-Mobile service. While we don't have an exact ETA, this is definitely a priority and our engineers will have everything up and running again by the end of the day. In the meantime, you can continue to use your calls, text, and data over wifi so that you don't lose your services." But still no service. Hopefully tomorrow. They also told me that using the wifi calling wouldn't affect my Data. I hope they are right (I will be checking it). Not sure the merger with Sprint was the best thing. Seemed like we had better service before the merger.  Posted on 4/30/2020.

I called that center earlier this week and was told it was no longer there and that is is somewhere between PA and IL.  I called again just now (and got the same person, Diane, on the phone) and she assured me again that it wasn't there.  When I asked several times about how this could be when there was no departure scan, she "stuck to the script" and all she would say is that "we dispatch our entire building every day so it's not here."  I had even told her that I'd been in touch with USPS employees and had been advised that nothing moves without a scan.  Am I being lied to and/or brushed off?I can't even file a claim because this was just a lowly media mail package.  Not too optimistic that I'm ever going to see it.

4897034256	2020-05-01T12:06:29	None	istheservicedown	I have packages that have been out for 40 days now waiting to get here. Some that have come to the US, then got turned around and sent back to Europe...then flipped back around and sent back to the United States. Two have shown at my regional distribution center for two days. One hasnt updated from shipping label created for over a week. Now the website is down for tracking to keep us farther in the dark
4897048032	2020-05-01T12:22:15	slp968	istheservicedown	USPS Informed Delivery just came up...but NO PACKAGES. Oops, no it appears I.D. is down...again! While there, I clicked to look at the "no packages" link, and service was down, when it showed 6 pkgs at 5am and tracking. Appears service is down, well, when people actually want and need to use it?Or maybe when one of your pkgs took 6 DAYS to apparently move from 1 facility to another within the same city...maybe? And one is tracking movement of a pkg supposed to be delivered 4-25 and it's STILL "lost" and filed complaint has been ignored, as usual. I DID get an email asking what I thought of USPS handling of my complaint, as usual, but no actual RESPONSE from USPS yet, as requested. They'll hear about it soon...but it will accomplish NOTHING, again, as usual.Stone Mtn. GA. GA, the black hole for mail.EDIT: Back up again and that lost pkg is still lost...seemingly "tracked" from 1 facility to another, in Atlanta, for 6 days now. Others arrive and go out in a day or 2? Are they just tracking the number and not the actual pkg, stalling answering question "where is my pkg"?
4897072201	2020-05-01T12:47:39	None	istheservicedown	My package tracking number is 9400108205496253145837.  It is a USPS First Class package that was shipped from North Hollywood, CA on 4/23 and was supposed to arrive to me around 4/27.  The latest update on tracking is that it arrived on 4/28 at 9:38am and has been sitting in a USPS facility/post office in Clifton, NJ for 3 days now.  This is a different town from where I live, and I don’t think it’s a distribution center.  Should I be concerned that my package got lost here?  I get there are delays due to the virus, but I haven’t had this issue with any of my other packages these past few weeks.  Just in case, I filed a claim for this already yesterday morning, but no one has responded yet.
4897081974	2020-05-01T12:57:13	disqus_wsEoOs7S5L	istheservicedown	All of our services are out. Phone, internet and cable. We called and were told there is a power plant down and that was the problem.  Our services are still out, but the map shows there are no outages. Everyone around us is out, so I do not understand how this can show no outages. We have had problems for months with Suddenlink’s internet running slow and going out. We’ve reset our equipment and it never fixes the problem. Last time they sent someone out and he said it was spiking which means it was a problem on Suddenlink’s end. Please get this fixed. We are working from home due to Covid-19 and can’t work if the service is not fixed.
4897097985	2020-05-01T13:12:33	None	istheservicedown	I have been having issues with my internet service from March and it works for a few hours then down again.I understand with the pandemic that most people are working remotely but  you cannot get to speak with anyone at Optimum! Everyday I get on the phone recording says everyone is still busy (paraphrasing) then disconnects the call! Yet they never delayed in sending out bills for full service or increase the price with their promotional price ends. This is crazy as I need to work from home and the Wi-Fi keeps cutting out and my daughter is flipping out as she has schoolwork to do.Unacceptable, as a long time customer it may be time to move to another ISP.

I did ask her several times about "where's the departure scan" but just got that same "we dispatch the whole building" line each time.  And I did try to file a claim but the system wouldn't let me because this was a media mail package and not an insured package.  Is there a different claim form that I'm missing?  I already tried the "missing package" request but just got the standard "temporary mail delay" response.  Argh.

NONE of my numerous other recent pkgs have gone thru this many "transfers/in transit". Like they can't figure out what to do with THIS ONE, or they're lying? Reminds me of 1 pkg tracked delivered...to front porch in Lithonia GA! (Have copy of tracking) As it turned out, a LIE...no such address IN Lithonia. When it finally arrived, MANY days later, plainly marked address...IN Stone Mtn. MANY PO issues, many.

4898342869	2020-05-02T12:53:36	None	istheservicedown	This is sad for our country.  These delivery services are so disorganized. It seems all of them are having terrible service issues. Are they refunding any money that was paid for two or three day delivery and it takes a week? Probably not. And this needs to be looked into, that is unfair trade practices.  Taking money for services not rendered. UPS is giving better service than any of them. USPS lost a package and  says it was delivered. Pony express could do a better job.
4898347217	2020-05-02T12:58:44	disqus_CD9FnsF2z0	istheservicedown	I have a quick question for Max. I sent a priority envelope from my local usps office on the 21st of April for Petersburg, MI. Tracking shows that it departed Indy on April 22 and it is now in transit to its next location. I have been in contact with my local usps office and they regretfully do not anything to offer regarding its currrent location. Do you have any insight as to the current location? While I realize that all usps offices are overloaded, I am beginning to feel that it may not arrive. Thank you for communicating with us Max. Tracking number is: 9505514137490112848252

4898413757	2020-05-02T14:09:35	None	istheservicedown	I have sent out 4 packages of poshmark sales this week that I physically handed to my mail carrier because of the value of the goods ($500 in poshmark sales), the shipments were never tracked or scanned in and have now been in transit for 6 days. I called the post office and they said they are receiving similar calls. Usually those packages would have delivered by now... I am probably SOL but I suspect my mail carrier took the packages for herself. One of the was clearly a Nordstrom return due to names on the label ($150). Not sure what to do.

We always  book a tech after they always tell us the problem is our end. Of course when its time for them to come they don't because surprise, surprise the problem turns out to be a network issue. 2  days without internet. Kids trying to do online schooling. I know its an extra load right now  but lower your prices if you cant deliver or start refunding.. If you don't want to do that you must start delivering a better service. That isn't an unreasonable request.

4901256233	2020-05-04T21:09:26	None	istheservicedown	After getting cut off during 3 calls to Verizon, last person I spoke with a few minutes ago confirmed major outages all over US and she was notified during our call that Tech Support is down as well. I can't receive calls. IF after dialing a # 5 or 6 times I get connected only to have much static or dropped calls. Anyone trying to call gets thrown into voice mail and vm delivery is often delayed as well. This is bad...
4901284246	2020-05-04T21:31:42	thomas_willoughby	istheservicedown	Jacksboro, TN. AT&T is the worst service I have ever dealt with for the past five years. Plain old telephone system used to be great. Had nothing but issues and problems with DSL service and U-verse since. Every time they want to send out a technician when there is an issue and they always say there is never a problem or an outage. Finally have told them to quit sending technicians as there is no problem in the house. System always works when a technician is scheduled to come out. Just have not taken the time to switch to Comcast. Lately I just have to wait until the system decides to come back online. Still their service totally sucks.

That afternoon they changed the status to Pending with No Delivery Information. It is now 5/5/2020 and I cannot get an answer on why this has not been delivered. My Mom is 90 years old and she depends on her shipments of food to feed her cats. Yesterday I spoke to a representative who told me they would contact me asap. Still no word almost 24 hours later. This morning I contacted chewy.com and am awaiting their update. This is absolutely unexceptable. Worst delivery service ever. Had the same problem with them long before the virus outbreak, so coronavirus is not to blame for their poor service.

(I found out that The seller used the same exact USPS Label on the two packages!) I have yet to receive a tracking number! It has been over 48 hours.  What does the same label on both packages mean for me? The seller told me that they were mailed in clear mailers so the post office personnel will know it is not a duplicate package.  I don’t know what to do. The seller has stopped communicating with me.

This is y'alls issue and I am not a tech, you do not pay me to figure it out... Therefore after only less than a month of service why should I pay for you to fix it?

The Wave TV person said she was not aware of any Ch 9 issues in Silverdale or along Anderson Hill Rd.  Outage was a mix of 3-4 second bursts of pic+sound followed by minutes of blank screen with only the KCTS logo in the bottom right corner of our Samsung "Smart TV."  The Wave person fiddled and was able to return Ch 9.  Fine.  Then again at the start of the Rick Steves pgm  (7pm) a repeat of the 5pm occurrence.  After a bit of fiddling I gave up/switched to another channel (all seemed to work flawlessly!)  Then back to Ch 9  around 7:35.  Ch 9 is up and working.  Time now is 7:48.  Enough.  Ted B

4903421814	2020-05-06T15:25:11	disqus_iUiw6rR2Rn	istheservicedown	Hi everyone, just wanted to share a "success story" to give you some hope that your packages will ultimately be delivered.  I had one that left NYC on April 15 and arrived in Pittsburg on April 18.  And there it sat, with the last update on April 22 telling me it was "In Transit to Next Facility" but with *no* departure scan.  Despite this, I was assured several times by the Pittsburgh NDC that it was on its way.  I am an incredibly pessimistic (and impatient!) person, and was firmly convinced that my package had disappeared.  But yesterday it arrived in Carol Stream, IL and was in my mailbox this morning, completely undamaged.  So, be patient and optimistic.  :-)  And THANK YOU to Max for diligently looking into all of our inquiries!!!

Both Ebay and the Mastercard representatives point to Paypal being the problem but as noted by many of you PayPal do not respond. There is no route on their web sites to talk to a human. It is all automated responses which just take you around in circles. Grrrrrrr!!!!!

I have been relying on media mail for my business for years and I’ve never had so many delayed/missing packages until now. I realize the pandemic has created an unprecendented situation and I thank you for all your hard work. Do you think I should suspend my shipments until things get back on track?

4903765368	2020-05-06T19:48:01	elmansalayev	istheservicedown	Hi Max,There've been some developments. On April 30th they scanned the package (Tracking showed that it left the facility) but at the post office they told me that they just scanned it. Then they scanned it again on March 4th. I went to the post office again and they told me that for some reason it's looping around (no problem with address, they checked). I'm really frustrated since it's been almost a months that it's been sitting in ny distribution center. What do you think the problem could be?Thank you

Was even marked as delivered once, then marked on vehicle for delivery. few days later was changed to at facility delivery pending. Calls to them answered by overseas operators you can barely understand with no resolution. Was told it is on the truck to be delivered soon. Asked for a call from the facility, was told they would call. Got a voice mail from a call from the 800 number at 10;30 at night, couldn't even understand the message as the caller could barely speak English.. overseas call again! I understand the delays and am ok with it due to the situation, but honest communication would help!!!!!

With so many people working from home, this is unacceptable. If there is legitimate problems during the day, please instruct your customer service line with what the problem is and why it's been happening all week. Give a heads up to customers, and reimburse us for the days our internet is down - we cannot even go to a coffee shot and work, I just need to take PTO every time you do this during working hours.

4906481106	2020-05-08T19:50:37	None	istheservicedown	After the postal worker admitted to tampering with my mail, I had to pickup my checks at the bank, dispute credit card charges and investigate other fraud attempts.  I received a boilerplate apology and despite requesting her transfer, the federal paid employee continues to make threats not to deliver my mail.This week we experienced another issue when she parked in front of our driveway.  We could not leave or enter as she walked mail to other homes.  We never experienced any problems with Al whom was a wonderful essential in our community.  Others neighbors have confided they too have experienced issues with this individual's behavior.NO mail again today.  Packages pending hold at the customer request (not requested) did not arrive either.  Harassment of a homeowner and tax payer by an admitted federal employee fraud playing the race card is simply unacceptable.  Filing another complaint with the inspector general!

4908066559	2020-05-10T05:23:07	frankcaban	istheservicedown	hi ali, the simple answer is no and yes. No restart (either via the website, app, plug/unplugg or even factory default) will work, i tried them all and been having problems as well. The fact is, comcast is notorious for "throttling down" internet speeds to keep the network going. That means that you probably have half the speed (or less) and will be subjected to interruption in streaming services and/or gaming. They cannot handle the weekend quarantine traffic (especially with how cold it is, more people are using it than ever this particular weekend.). Your best bet is to turn on/off your connection to your modem/wifi (via airplane mode or just disconnecting and reconnecting) instead of flat our restarting the modem. Sometimes it happens to me, the connection is lost but it doesn't re-connect, so i manually connect/reconnect and boom its back. There is no need to restart your router as it is not the problem (and takes forever).
4908068243	2020-05-10T05:26:39	davidbrodman	istheservicedown	No internet in Bronx, NY
4908069206	2020-05-10T05:28:38	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Yes indeed, I do not live in your area, but my area has been pretty stable for living right in the heart of Baltimore until the quarantine happened. On weekends its like the network can't handle it (especially this weekend with the cold front). Too many people online at the same time, on top of that,  they make upgrades to the system and they ironically need to lower their capacity as they power down individual sectors/units to increase the overall capacity. That's why one day your internet is good, then bad and them BOOM greater than ever, then ok/good again and the cycle continues blah blah blah (sadly with comcast it never lasts lol)
4908072445	2020-05-10T05:35:32	frankcaban	istheservicedown	(Baltimore) Internet is up but spotty. Some pages lag a bit, and streaming sometimes faulty (freezes then returns, aka lag). For gamers it's pretty obvious, especially if the game disconnects you once it detects no connection (freeze), you can also notice it in pages, you may click on a link and kind of freezes up for a bit or images/ads/etc that normally load real fast just freeze up for a second or two.  Also pretty much everyone I know here in Baltimore reports this happening after 7pm and on the weekends, they are literary rationing the internet capacity. Comcast always sucks, but this is due to the quarantine for sure based on the days/hours it happens specifically.
4908073122	2020-05-10T05:37:01	senthura	istheservicedown	If everything is indeed backed up so badly then a statement needs to be placed on the website about this because otherwise delays are not expected and create undue worry or issues on both customer and merchant side. None of the backed up places are listed to be impacted on the website as of now. It feels like the problem is being hidden and people will gladly blame a retailer or seller for a shipping backup.
4908074684	2020-05-10T05:40:30	jathatonegooner	istheservicedown	Optimum has to be the worst service provider.  No internet here in the Bronx
4908077517	2020-05-10T05:46:44	frankcaban	istheservicedown	I know pauline! it is almost criminal and surely shameful. On top of that check this out: when i moved into this apartment, the landlady reported an issue and they never fixed it, it just got fixed like 5 days later to the general public, BUT they did manage to trick that poor sweet landlady into buying a new "packaged deal" that would set her back 350 dollars a year (all she has is rent, and social security). She got lucky I detected their shennanigans and put them in their place, but they would have probably gotten away with it, they are literary robbing old people, the disabled, and well the "technological illiterate" crowd, shame on them, millions on executive bonuses (which they dont deserve)  and they can't keep a damn network stable.
4908079423	2020-05-10T05:51:00	frankcaban	istheservicedown	true it is due to the quarantine. Cable internet has always been known for "clogging" up and even though they have made advances as the years go by, it can't handle the quarantine traffic (especially on weekends and late evening/nights). It's not just comcast, but im pretty sure most people suffering have a cable provider (its affecting DSL too, but not as much)
4908081967	2020-05-10T05:56:31	frankcaban	istheservicedown	You want to see frustrating? google their executives pay bonuses. Bonuses for messing up what when you it add up, is similar to the amount of money needed to fix their damn infrastructure. Also they love to prey on old people, the disabled and "mentallly challenged", and of course plain normal people than don't have a tech background with confusing packages, security upgrades (which dont really do much and cost way too much) etc etc and horrible contracts. Monopoly is bad for everyone except a couple of executives and several shareholders.
4908083829	2020-05-10T06:00:40	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Good luck. Comcast is a monopoly, it's one of the reasons they don't care, they literary don't care and yes they do have the money and manpower/resources to fix it all. They rather give that to their executives (as bonuses),  bribes (through lobbying in D.C/congress) and marketing. Since they have a monopoly, they don't care about customer service, because they know the alternatives either cost too much, or it's like 1999 internet speeds lol.
4908085066	2020-05-10T06:03:35	frankcaban	istheservicedown	It's the quarantine, they can't handle the traffic.

I would NEVER recommend COMCAST/XFINITY to anyone.  Their cheap REMOTE doesn't even have a light so often times i use a flashlight to see the options.  Why not just give their customers a decent rate and stop the bullshit.  They want us to call and complain so they can give us a couple bucks off and land another contract....I'm done with COMCAST/XFINITY..........FOREVER !!!

I've had to switch back and forth the gateway IP on my Wi-Fi router between 70.187.26.1 and 68.13.116.1, at which point the DHCP works, the router gets a new IP and DNS and everything works, but only after I do this.

Every representative just passes the buck to the next representative which is 2x worse than the prior one. Now  72 hrs later ( today 5-11-2020) i still can't transfer money, change or add a new bank or bank card, can't get cash back. Which is to generate a code through paypal and then go to a Walmart to get the cash you requested. I was told on 5/8/20 That the system detected a purchase ( something like that but P.P wont tell me what or whom it was from.  I haven't bought anything in the last month feom anyone besides cvs, walgreens, target) and that i should 1take my money out of account, transfer it,  generate a code for cash until my issue can be fixed. I started to explain via message to P.P. that my card has more than enough funds to cover purchases, and i can not do anything they have suggested what so ever. This is where i call them out P.P. with this so called security issue they say i am having. I went to walmart, gathered items needed and went to checkout. My card was declined. I then tried 1x more time and card declined. I then started to message them( when P.P. says someone will be with you in the " via text message " within the hr expect to wait 8 plus hours)  while i had walmart suspend my order to find out why and what the issue was. So i decided to wait off to the side for the 1 hour,  then two hours passed  and on the third hour i had to leave walmart without any food/ formula. For thise wondering why i waited / stayed inside walmart in lieu of leaving or waiting in the car. : ( P.P. message sent to me said  that a represenative wld be with me within 1hr. As well as The line to get back into walmart was about 2+ hrs long and wrapped around the building,  It was cold "26° F" snowing here that day in Massachusetts and to wait outside was torture especially having a personal handicap that limits the time i can stand in place).  In that three hr window i continued to try and purchase these items knly because walmart manager said that there was a code that they never seen on their screen that generates after purchase is declined. This happened 6x. Nit one of the codes were the same and notbone of 1/6 codes generated was insufficient funds. So on the 7th and 8th time ( card never locked per store manager, this was why i was able to keep trying)  i was able to purchase two things at a total of $45. I couldn't purchase the two item together for $45 because it declined but i was avke to purchase each item separately ( two transactions). Then card declined on the 3rd try ( all together 9 attempts)  purchase declined  diapers for twins at $39.98 but allowed 2 more separate transactions allowing me to purchase  2 bags diapers in sep transactions totaling the original  amount of $39.98  that was initially declined. So now 7 hrs later, i get a response from rep to " get cash" & or "change payment method"  with instructions. I sent a D.M. hours prior stating that i couldn't do anything with my card , explained walmart incident.My conversation was left " open/active" and once again messaged P.P. to reiterate my issues . Then ( 48 hours later still without any help) i am tild that someone will call me. Rep told  me that a rep will be calling me byvthr end of the day. Made sure to confirm( via message, proof) that i confirmed that someone live qas to call me within 5 hrs. Another lie! No one called. Then receive a message that i should call paypal at 888-221-**** for assistamce and live rep. Nope, another lie. I just get the same message when  calling P.P. number  given then DISCONNECTED. Now i have sent them 3x more messages because my daughter has down syndrome amd i need to pick uo her medical essentials but all funds, unemployment benefits , everything goes on this card.  I can't get any state assistance because i make too much money via unemployment so i am left in the hands of P.P. I can nit do one thing with card yet i keep getting told to do x y, z to it to withdraw funds.So jow on day 3 without her heart meds, food, dog food because i can't get help from paypal. All i get is lies and to explain  my issue with the next rep from p.p. for the 17th time. I need help, i need essentials for family to survive.
4909892311	2020-05-11T18:52:57	None	istheservicedown	Can't get into amazon seller. The landing page is up and you can go through the ten step login to try and get in and then at the end it tells you, "The web page you're looking for doesn't exist." Then it tells you to hit the link to the home page which leads to a page that is downed.The first time I assumed it was down for maintenance, but today I noticed it doesn't mention any maintenance or even why the page is down. Now I have a new found hate for that thing that thing that asks you three times to type out the letters to prove you're not a robot even though it lops off the bottom of some of the letters so you can't tell if you're looking at a g or a q! Also if you say you have trouble with it or are vision impaired it lets you listen to the letters and type that, but after you answer it then it switches right back to the visual puzzle!

Funny enough, now I ran into a problem with USPS as well. A purchase I made on Amazon was delivered on Sunday to a business address that's closed during the weekend.

Is there any way to get the package redelivered? I found a Redelivery Service form at the USPS website but it is asking for information that I do not posses. What can I do?

4911228117	2020-05-12T17:46:29	bankkiller	istheservicedown	For 10 days internet goes out. 5PM or later, usually around 7:30. Repair man came and changed the wire pair ("to say something had been done. We know our line is a problem". ) and sure enough later that night internet went out. Today it is during the day at 9 AM! Repair man coming tomorrow and this time I need to make clear that their line is bad...even though Century Link admits the issue is NOT on my end or my equipment. Looking at switching to satelitte of some sort, not dish or Comcast, for sure! Century link lowered by bill to 55.00 and increased speed but that is worthless when there is no internet.

They have called me back about 3 times and each time I answer they hang up. We are old and need our home phone in case of emergency so the police or ambulance can locate us via our house phone.  This has happened twice. My husband was too shook to dial a number all he could do was 911 and they found us via house phone. Saved my life twice.

I filled out a form yesterday on the USPS website called approximately “where is my package” and they called me today and kept telling me the package was delivered on Saturday and that I should have gotten it. I explained that the seller used the same USPS label twice and that I only got one package. He said their were no other packages tied to my tracking number. I asked what happens to the other package, and if it is just sitting in an Illinois post office and the person didn’t know. Ugh. At least I got my money back from the platform I bought the items from.

4911818784	2020-05-13T03:01:40	None	istheservicedown	Tell the service tech to check for noise in side your home or on your drop. That will cause random pixilation. If it’s happening on only one tv then it’s limited to that single outlet. If it’s on all tv’s then it is probably your service drop, or if you have an amplifier in your home, it has the wrong power supply and isn’t getting the correct amount of voltage.

4911894657	2020-05-13T05:01:59	robert_walter	istheservicedown	Hi Max,a pkg on way to me in Switzerland is creeping along thru system. Mailed in MI 4/20. Arr Detroit Dist Ctr 4/20.  Arr Chic Intl Dist Ctr 5/1. (t0+11 days)famous “in transit to next facility” 5/5 (t0+15)(HH004064315US)Another item was mailed same place and way to me on 5/1. (LH097315844US)Arr Philly 8th. Arr Jersey City 10th. Arr Jamaica NY 11th. In transit to next facility 12th. (t0+4days). I read that some items are being put on ships meaning 4-5 weeks to get here and wondering if these shipments might be so affected. I’m assuming the one at JFK (Jamaica NY) 5844 would seem to be staging for a plane. Looks good. But the first one 4315 seems to be at your station in Chicago (assume due to Philly reroutes you described) since the 1st (not counting 5/5 in transit). Any idea if this is being staged for air from ORD?I’m in no hurry just curious what’s going on but would appreciate any info clarification you can give. I am very appreciative of our USPS and want you to know I have contacted all my federal representatives asking them to support and fund the USPS. Thank you.

4911949470	2020-05-13T06:49:51	disqus_Gwq4KPCsWb	istheservicedown	Hello Max, I’ve recently been having an issue with USPS delivery service and I am a now concerned. I was supposed to receive a package from Rossford, Ohio to Los Angeles yesterday, May 11 but never received it. The weird thing is that it said that on the tracking it says that it arrived to the distribution center but was running late. As of now it reads to “In transit to Next Facility” with no expected delivery date. I’m not sure what is the issue as I have never experienced delayed packages before but I will truly appreciate it if you can help me in understanding what the issue is. Thank you.

4912955592	2020-05-13T22:01:55	None	istheservicedown	Hey Max. They definitely did use the same label. I’m thinking maybe the label fell off because it wasn’t so secure on the package I did receive. The package I did receive arrived in a “damaged bag” from the USPS even though the items were not damaged. Who knows where it ended up.
4912956848	2020-05-13T22:03:02	henryboerner	istheservicedown	Think about where we are headed.  Tele classes.  tele heath.  tele work at home.  safety info via digital platforms.  we need - must have -always on, always reliable internet connections.  no slow, down, on off performance.  Altice must step up and provide this -- it is not an optional thing, having internet or not.  everyone must have connection they can count on.  all the time.  period.  this is the future we are living in now and we must have service we can count on as a matter of priority in so many areas of our daily life.  Help!

I realize more people are online now during this pandemic, but that’s not the problem. Unless you have a system that will credit all the accounts for all of the time we were left without service. Since we know that would never proactively happen, we should all just do some basic math and deduct it ourselves or start a class action lawsuit. If I don’t perform my duty at work I will loose my seat to someone that will. We have enough stress dealing with the coronavirus. Now that we are stuck home more often than before we have to be told by your fake empathetic customer service reps with all their understanding and apologies. I’m fed up!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

Hire temporary workers who aren't terrified oF a virus that kills.  .0001% The public are tired of your excuses! We are still going to work and doing our essential jobs.

It,s about time for a new service provider since Spectrum can not provide reliable service.the service they do provide is no better then old dial up at the cost of High speed.Total shit for the price.My advice to you is to find a differant provider and let Spectrum go belly up.

Needless to say it was not delivered, and now they are not even showing when it might be delivered.  Package is still sitting in Warwick, RI.  Phone goes automated, and you can't speak to anyone.  Email just comes back saying conditions beyond their control.  Guess I should have gone with USPS or FedEx.

Today it dropped again. I have the firestick on all tv’s and work from home. It makes it completely miserable and hard to function without internet that I pay tons of money to utilize. Upsetting. The website always says no outage in my area too.
4916365545	2020-05-16T18:17:52	None	istheservicedown	Apparently we have to pay for the time that we’ve had the internet even thoe they said not to worry because of covid-19. And they say they sent a letter I never received now I have to pay 276 dollars to get it turned back on
4916365707	2020-05-16T18:18:02	Jmadore_84_84	istheservicedown	Our internet is currently "unprotected" and causing issues with our cell phones. We have a VERY weak signal and most apps are not working properly. Why is our internet "unprotected" and how do we repair the issue ASAP? This started around 6:30-7am (this is when we first discovered the issue). Everything was working properly late last night. Very frustrating and having our internet unprotected is worrisome.

But since USPS couldn’t locate the package I ordered the books again and the new package already shipped and I’m supposed to get the new package tomorrow. So annoying. Now I am going to have 2 copies of books I shouldn’t. Disappointed that USPS couldn’t locate the original package that was lost. This shouldn’t have happened.

4916381002	2020-05-16T18:34:37	Jmadore_84_84	istheservicedown	Our internet signal is weak and currently displaying as 'unprotected'. This is interfering with our cell phones' ability to properly connect to apps and causing apps to freeze, pages/articles won't load and a slew of other issues are occurring. Why is our internet 'unprotected' and what can we do to remedy the issue ASAP? This is both frustrating and worrisome.
4916384412	2020-05-16T18:38:14	earlwilborn	istheservicedown	What does that have to do with the U.S.P.S. playing ping pong with my package? Your reply is a non-sequitir.
4916392424	2020-05-16T18:46:49	disqus_PCGbtbi8pH	istheservicedown	We have been waiting 10 days  and 13 days for our three FedEx deliveries. All three say "Pending". The packages were delivered to the Buffalo,NY Hub where they sat for five days and then they were moved to the Rochester/Henrietta hub, over an hour away from our house and they are still sitting there. I have called Customer Service and they told me that they cannot get an answer or solution because Henrietta hub isn't answering their phones or returning calls, texts or emails. One of our packages was supposed to be a two day delivery. This is unacceptable and incredibly bad business practice. Updating the tracking and explaining the delays or lost packages and telling us exactly when our packages will be delivered is the minimum they can do.

4916911937	2020-05-17T07:36:38	hailjeebus	istheservicedown	The seller shouldn't have used the same label on 2 different packages. That's called stealing. You have to pay per package... You don't get a buy one get one free discount with USPS, you have to purchase two separate labels. Asking them to track both packages would be like asking you to call two separate people with the same phone number.
4916915213	2020-05-17T07:44:09	hailjeebus	istheservicedown	Kathy,I had a package stuck in Baltimore for 9 days. It depends on the postage because they're backed up. Priority packages seems to get through but everything else just sits. I filed a claim and got mine the next day, which was yesterday.

ATT has a monopoly in our area. Lying turds. My opinion is this is due to low bandwidth because if BUSINESSES needing the bandwith for their home workers and residents suffer!

4917823569	2020-05-18T02:51:23	None	istheservicedown	On April 8th there was a huge storm in Indjanapolis.  At that time my signal strength dropped from 3 to 4 bars to 0 -1 bars most of the time. After spending hours on phone with Verizon they won't admit there's a problem with their signal but it's been very obvious. Very disappointing. Quality of my new phone and quality of my signal has been lacking. Probably my last contract with Verizon.

Greenwood, IN "shipping partner"4203262192748927005364010000503500All of these items are apparently not with usps yet. If the tracking info is correct. Some say they departed the shipping partner facility, then a couple hours later it shows it arrived, at the same facility. Then nothing new. I cannot get a usps investigation launched, bc they say they are not in possession of the items, which is how it shows on the tracking info as well. Any assistance would be GREATLY appreciated.

4919148199	2020-05-19T03:01:25	davidahotchkiss	istheservicedown	Max, here are the tracking numbers. I apologize for the delay, I had quite a few doctor appts today. 1. Greenwood, IN "shipping partner"42032621927489270053640100005852612. Ridgefield, NJ "shipping partner"42032621927489270053640100006157843. Greenwood, IN "shipping partner"4203262192748927005364010000503500All of these items are apparently not with usps yet. If the tracking info is correct. Some say they departed the shipping partner facility, then a couple hours later it shows it arrived, at the same facility. Then nothing new. I cannot get a usps investigation launched, bc they say they are not in possession of the items, which is how it shows on the tracking info as well. Any assistance would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you very kindly Max! David Hotchkiss
4919148439	2020-05-19T03:01:44	None	istheservicedown	My package was to be delivered here in Phx, Az Friday May 15th between noon & 4pm. Mid afternoon received notice "beyond their control" delivery rescheduled to Monday May 18th again between noon & 4pm. Well, it's the 18th & still no show. It's already almost 8pm, no notice from them yet but just watched UPS drive by my house twice to deliveries & then driving past my home again. Got on with chat at UPS which claims my package will still delivered by the end of the night.  This is ridiculous! This is a waste of staying home now twice since my package requires a signature.

You'll have great Karma in your life for your tireless patience, communication and assistance. Stay safe and blessed!

Now it’s delayed til Tuesday May 26th BUT the UPS website says there’s no known date when the package will be back on the road. It’s stuck in Mesquite Texas. So why tell me “May 26th” then no info when it will leave Texas. I looked up weather and just see scattered thunderstorms in Mesquite. No tornadoes or anything. So why is it delayed? I know COVID Is messing things up. But I think this is beyond that.

4923659005	2020-05-22T16:06:30	None	istheservicedown	Been having “No Service” for the past couple of weeks. Normally have at least 3 bars while inside my own house—now I barely get anything. Last night (5/21/2020), had “No Service” until 6:16AM the next day (5/22/2020). And it’s only at 1 or 2 bars, really weak and low signal. It’s been difficult getting any calls. I get it; these are hard times for everyone but this is also unacceptable, too. People are working from home and need the service to be in working order so we can continue to pay for the services. It’s a bit upsetting.

4925973869	2020-05-24T16:43:39	Finally_an_Intellectual	istheservicedown	Down since 5/23 morning in Munds Park, Arizona and Flagstaff, AZ.  Always get the same answer, "everything looks fine from our end".  This is NOT wifi btw, it is hardwired to computer and still no internet connection, or at best 1-2 mbps when we are paying for the max they offer in Munds Park, which is 20 mbps download.  Upload is a joke, less than 1mbps ALWAYS.  They have a contract with the city of Flagstaff and surrounding areas, 20 years, that guarantees they will provide, at a minimum, "the average" internet speeds and service request response times of other major carriers throughout the state.  In last 6 years, I have had them out over 30 times for the same problem and the technicians always give us the same BS....and never do anything about it.  They brought out a new modem just last week, so that familiar excuse of theirs doesn't hold water either.

Was told there was no problem in my area and they would try to rebuild my network. A few stations came on but still no internet. A couple hours later there were no channels on the TV. Called again 5/24. The guy told me his internet was freezing up and he would have to call me back in 5 or 10 minutes. That was 33 hrs ago. Called again was told there was nothing wrong in my area again and that they'd have to send out a service tech on Wednesday 5/27. Was told if it was the router/modem that they had one on their truck then later in the conversation I was told the guy couldn't come in the house and if it was something in the house I'd have to reschedule and they'd send a different Tech out. The internet came on for a few hours today 5/25 but no TV. Now the TV and Internet are working. But there was no problem in the area and was probably my router/modem...???

(Its COVID, im sitting in the house all damn day) The next they say its in "transit" one time they actually said the address was wrong. WTF!? I call customer service and its the same CIRCUS act. Everyone has no idea. I've even spoke with higher ups saying the same thing. We should all report this crappy FedEx to the BBB. This is unreal for a business establishment with peoples belongings.

No email, text or call saying there is an issue, no apology for any inconvenience—denial about any issue though-plenty of denial.  Customer service agents who talk to you like you are having an I-d-10-t error and are to blame for the lack of service-yep that block is checked.  It is the year 2020-the likelyhood of someone calling your tech support/customer service lines who hasn’t already tried to troubleshoot their own modem on their own is pretty slim now.  Our society has had modems for a quarter century now and personally I do not take kindly to being talked to like I have the mental acuity of a box of bran flakes!!!  Get our Internet and phone service back up and running, invest some time and money in improving your infrastructure before you lose the few customers you have left.  The only reason we are a customer is because the shopping center isn’t wired for any other ISP.  That, however, is already in the works—the clock is ticking CenturyLink!!!

They need actual people doing customer support, there is no excuse to leave people hanging. I'm sure there is a safe way to have live customer support or do they like hiding behind that to cover up their problems. 18 days is a long time. Are my packages lost, in a truck somewhere waiting for a driver, quarantined?

4929703018	2020-05-27T17:49:18	handone	istheservicedown	I have 6 packages 2 with UPS & 4 with USPS, where ebay tracking says the USPS 4 were delivered, I have not gotten 1 pkg., except for 1 UPS pkg left on my deck addressed to someone else. The 2 UPS  pkg 1 returned the other sitting waiting for address correction. when it is the same address for 15 yrs. I am  former FedEx worker,(retired), & I believe there is a connection to the merger of UPS taking a pkg to the destination's closest post office & then they (USPS)deliver it.  Which many shippers used this service for my pkgs & it took 7-12 days for delivery. shipping it via USPS standard mail, would've been faster.Federal Express better jump on the band wagon & grab all these online shoppers pkg deliveries, for this is the way customers are going to shop. Keep up their remarkable & dependable delivery record, but better lower the price on online sellers, before a new company grabs it all. Note that I still communicate with friends still with FedEx & they claim that FedEx is treating them poorly, & benefits decreasing, to the point they want to look for new employment. Basically "FedEx has gone way down hill since I worked for them. What in the Hell is wrong with you FRED SMITH. FedEx is still the best out there, & used to be 1 of the VERY FEW employers that gave a damn about their  employees..Socialism taking over the USA, Better wake Trump 2020

4929864072	2020-05-27T19:52:52	disqus_KPI0LCaWVg	istheservicedown	EVERY time a package goes through the Oak Park location it’s always an issue. This by far has been the worst experience. A package that I am required to sign for was suppose to be delivered 5/20 (it wasn’t) tracking number stated that it was in transit for days then nothing for a few days. Tracked the package 5/26 & it stated that it was out for delivery. 1:48 pm I receive a notification that the package delivery was attempted but the customer was unavailable (FLATOUT LIE). No delivery attempt was made. The following day when tracking the package it stated that @ 9:16 am the package was on the truck for delivery. I then receive a notification at 2 something in the afternoon that the package will now be Deliv the following day. I call FedEx customer service & the rep basically told me that the package has never left the Oak Park facility there was never a delivery attempt made & the Oak Park location is working on getting packages delivered & could not provide a time frame. So am I just suppose to sit in the house all day every day with my fingers crossed that I’d get my package. What is the point in having a tracking number is the information it’s providing is not correct. I truly feel that it’s something shady going on at this location & my package was stolen.

4930771660	2020-05-28T13:47:18	None	istheservicedown	I placed an order on 5-11, processed on 5-13, shipped 5-14, and it was coming from CA to MI. It arrived at Fed Ex in Oak Park on 5-19 with a status of "in transit" since then. Its not 5-28. Why is everything just sitting there? You can't get through to customer service and even if you do you get placed on hold until your hung up on. You can't even go there and pick up your package either so don't bother.I understand a slight delay with everything going on in the world but no other delivery service/company USPS, UPS, Amazon, etc. is just holding packages in one facility not giving anyone answer's. I've even gotten other Fex Ex packages on time but they didnt go through Oak Park. Its CLEARLY just Oak Park.

4933096175	2020-05-30T02:33:32	None	istheservicedown	I’m also in Alexandria and was expecting multiple packages from different origins via UPS the past two days Thursday 5/28 and Friday 5/29. All four tracking numbers had different early morning “out for delivery” status updates, and sporadic repeats of this “out for delivery” message added every few hours, since 4am yesterday. Our UPS truck in our neighborhood has been completely MIA for at least these past two days. Customer service is 100% automated right now, but could the dispatch location at least update their item tracking numbers with updates as delayed? I wouldn’t think that’s too much to ask.

Reached out to Des Moines and no response. Sent me an email to do Mrc. Claim closed. This happened twice.I called Des Moines DC everyday last week. No answer.Called a random Des Moines post office and the manager there sent a “note” to distribution center. Told me should see movement if I don’t to call him back. There were 25 items in there. To file an mrc makes me a little crazed to consider. Customer care line told me June 5 would be a more likely delivery. As we near that I’m getting nervous. Advice?

High speed does not matter if the service is unreliable.

If it is due to the riots or destruction of signal towers in St. Paul, I wish they would just be upfront about it. Does anyone know what the cause is? They're quoting it won't be fixed until late on Tuesday.

4937806431	2020-06-02T16:29:58	disqus_kL2HTYF5vk	istheservicedown	Heritage Village Southbury CT here ( if anyone from Spectrum even READS these). WiFi not working. Went and got new Ethernet cable. Still not working. 45 minute and 25 minute  call waits for service rep. If the problem is with Spectrum,I should be able  to find this out on their site — but NO! Very nonspecific indication that there’s a problem, but not specifying what it IS. Grrrrrrr . . .
