They are going about saying that they are having no problems whatsoever and that data from this website is inaccurate. They are pretending to not know what is going on and dont want to admit it to save face.
4955542143	2020-06-15T22:08:11	veracromwellreese	downdetector	US verizon	I have Verizon and I can make some calls but other numbers show failed call. My location is Maryland.
4955544024	2020-06-15T22:10:01	fritzwire6963	downdetector	US verizon	Problem here is that a rep from Verizon went on to say that Verizon is having no issues whatsoever only that they know another carrier is having issues. And that this website is not really accurate.

It would definitely fail to t-mobile.  I'm not saying Verizon didn't have an outage, but it's definitive that there was a problem with T-Mobile and Sprint.  Their head of technology tweeted about it.

4955813713	2020-06-16T03:04:13	disqus_cMQfFqyGG5	downdetector	US verizon	I kind of feel the entire upgrade thing is a lie. I am in IT and upgrades are never performed in the middle of the day especially during the business week when use its at its daily peaks. It is something that is usually done late at night when there is the least amount of use. Also before upgrades are rolled out they are usually throughly tested on staging servers and then rolled out to production servers. So the fact that they are saying it was due to an upgrade sounds kind of reckless to me since it was done during a business day during peak usage times.

Causing the outage but I don't see why other carriers are affected unless it's a DDos attack witch is very possible with all that's been going on in this country the past few months

I have Xfinity WiFi and haven't noted any issues. I'm going to disconnect and see what happens. My brothers and I are Verizon Wireless customers.

But I'm guessing it has to do with them rolling out the 5G in certain cities and integrating the thing when most of the country has good reliable 4G why even change it to add the rest to the 5G when it isn't even close to being ready not too mention from my research going to cost us more? Besides that I'm guessing many people don't have a near phone that is even capable of using the 5G! I know I have the Moto Z3 and I'd have to purchase a mod to have access which I'm on a fixed budget so I have no intention of buying more to access it. I used to have great connection in my house and now it's one tiny bar or maybe 2 bars in the house! 5G still only works outside near the street where it does say it's available so why put the entire network on it?

What's really interesting is when I got online and searched 'Verizon DNS outage' a help box told me to do what I just did above, and that's telling...

4986156737	2020-07-10T00:12:34	MuswellHill	downdetector	US verizon	Have been trying to phone my son in Wichita on his landline.  He has AT&T package deal for landline and internet along with Direct-TV for satellite service.  The landline and satellite have been down for 3 days now.  He phoned AT&T this morning from his cell phone and they confirmed that the system was still all screwed up and not working and up through yesterday (I didn't check earlier today) both Verizon and AT&t had outages shown in phone and internet categories.  When somebody dials into my son's landline you get a recording about how its Verizon and the number can't be reached and to try later (which is why I am posting here AND AT&T as neither my son nor I understand how this account can somehow be Verizon and AT&T).  It then goes silent for a few seconds, then goes to a busy signal and then to a message saying all circuits are busy.  But it seems that according to Verizon everything is hunky-dory  and working right - when it obviously isn't.

Seems like the tower is down.  We had a pretty bad storm on Friday and if I had to guess it was running on battery backup since then.

From there moment you pass Asbury Anderson Road to Center St, there's ZERO COVERAGE. It claims to have EMERGENCY CALL Service available, but that too isn't operational. Bizarre how they're aren't any reports generated by Verizon. Verizon claims there aren't any problems to report.

4992890860	2020-07-15T15:29:19	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	This sounds like a local setting in your phone and nothing that has to do with Verizon. Within your settings for data there is an option for data cap to protect you from overage charges. Unless set to the correct dates of your billing cycle and what your data for the month is it will miscalculate and lock you out trying to protect you when you do in fact have data. Verizon would have no control over this but easily turned off if it's the case.

5001761106	2020-07-22T17:21:15	kendrahogan	downdetector	US verizon	Just got off 90 min call with Verizon. The network extender issue is nationwide. They don’t have an eta yet but since it’s a national problem, all technical support has been directed to fix it. When it’s fixed, you don’t need to reboot to make it start working again— it connect automatically. In the meantime, the best solution is using “WiFi calling”. The Verizon guy helped me test it and it works much better than I thought (and much better than the 1 bar I get from my Verizon signal)— of course it depends on the strength of your WiFi signal though.

Did power off and factory reset then transferred to Tier 2 support. First told there was a wireless outage in my area, but I questioned this as I was on my cell phone. Agent then clarified that the outage was for Network Extenders. Would have been nice if Verizon had pushed out notifications so we (customers) wouldn't have to waste our time or their support agents time with phone calls. I too am stuck on 11a, but sometimes bounces back to 8a then back to 11a.

Hooks up to your broadband (Ethernet or WiFi) and needs to be close to a window to have line of sight to GPS satellite. If you get lots of dropped calls and 1 bar or less signal in your home or property, then this can help.

Boy it would be sure nice to get some sort of an alert on this rather than wasting so much time trying to self-diagnose and fix.    This is a killer, as Verizon';s 13 year run of great coverage in our neighborhood came to an abrupt end 2 years ago, no no one in at least a square mile of us (in a very populated area) has gotten even passable service since the day they changed something.  Verizon has been giving out extenders like candy- that ceases to help the as you walk out any door of our house.

5004272178	2020-07-24T15:48:17	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Day 3, landline internet still down...no WiFi. Restarting/unplugging/resetting the router/modem doesn’t help. Live Chat is no help. Either they don’t answer my questions or the chat ends before I can get help (because I have Verizon for my cell service, too, and that connection is very poor as well). Can’t reach a live person on the phone. Automated support is useless... This is not worth $61.99 (which I can’t get a clear explanation of this on my bill or from a live person as to why 1.5 Mbps “high speed” internet costs this much...as it’s very slow) And the price has just kept increasing over the years (started at $21.99 or $29.99, then $40+, then $50+, now $60+) with no explanation other than “service and equipment fees” which they will not break down on paper or in person which means the charges are bogus. I’m paying FIOS prices (I should be getting 400mbps for what I pay monthly), but they keep telling me I, specifically me, can’t get FIOS because it is not yet available in my area. However, when I try to connect to my WiFi there are about 5 FIOS WiFi connections available. Their explanation is that it’s available for some of my neighbors and not others and that it isn’t available for my “apartment/unit” yet. I’ve been waiting and inquiring and requesting FIOS for 11 years now. WHEN is it going to become available for ME?! This is such a rip off. There are other services that charge $9.99 for the speeds you’re offering me at $61.99!!! And then they want to charge me $59.99 for a new router, that I’ve also needed for some years now... Ripoff...

5007862416	2020-07-27T17:56:42	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	After 3 days of no landline internet service I canceled my account with Verizon on Friday of this week (I’m pretty sure I still wouldn’t have had service today either). Billing cycle started over today (Monday) so I had to make an executive decision. I could risk possibly not having service for two weeks again and still have to pay the $61.99 for the “high speed” internet (of which they will only give me up to 1.5 mbps for that insane price) or just end this biased relationship and be done. Even tech support remembered me when I called Friday and asked if my internet wasn’t fixed about three days prior. Since I’ve canceled my Verizon landline internet service I’ve seen the Verizon technicians out here a lot. It’s too late for me though. I have cell service with Verizon as well and that sucks, too. I hope I don’t have to cancel that next.

I used to have Verizon wireless internet and due to high prices for data and poor service, I finally pulled the plug too.  I only wish I'd done it sooner haha!  I have had AT&T Fixed Wireless product for 2 or more years now and have loved it.  So superior!  You might want to check it out!
5010293212	2020-07-29T14:47:33	disqus_ObBXfZKLs9	downdetector	US verizon	You all might want to check out AT&T Fixed Wireless.  I've had it 2+ years now and it's so superior to Verizon hotspots or Mi-Fi devices like I had before that were way too expensive and where the service was very poor.  With Verizon, after 15 GIG, it reverted to 600K as you say.  With AT&T Fixed Wireless, I tend to get 25 to 30 meg download speeds and get 215 GIG of data per month.  10$ per extra 50 GIG if you go over the 215 GIG base.  Much superior to Verizon's wireless internet!

Slow service, poor signal, gives you the run around and passes the buck off on someone else. I should not have to explain multiple times the issues we are having. We have had them multiple times and no one want to listen. They want to keep trying other things. The same other things we already tried. I pay for the insurance for a reason and should not have to have a problem for weeks before getting someone to come look at the equipment. Shame!!!! You can go weeks with out service but they still want you to pay the normal monthly bill.

If you do, someone from verizon executive relations team will call you within a day or so and help you file a trouble ticket AND you don't have to wait on the endless hold for a person that just reads from a script.  You will get a real veteran verizon employee that's in the US, in a corporate office. They are the only ones that can get anything done.

There’s been no status update, no acknowledgement, nothing. It’s a terrible look.

Everytime I call verizon I spend hours on the phone just to hear there is an outage and that it will be fixed later that day or tomorrow. It is now Saturday and after spending 2 hours on the phone they are now telling me the outage is expected to be fixed by 09/06. How did we go from a few days to a whole month estimate? Thanks verizon you've officially made it harder for your customers during these already difficult times. What can they do for us you ask? Well I'm still on the phone on hold for hours at time. I'll let you know if they do anything at all or if I just have to switch my entire provider. Cheers to the most unhelpful customer support out there. Update: Spent another hour and a half after being put on hold with no response. Ended up hanging up. Extremely upset and disappointed in verizon.

5023699979	2020-08-09T12:53:20	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	My landline is down.  I was on hold yesterday for 2 hours.  When the music stopped and I said hello....they disconnected...ughhhh.  Today I decided to call back and opt for the option for them to call me back.  We scheduled it for 8:00 a.m.  (15 minutes away).  I thought no problem so I waited.  My phone alerts me that I have a voicemail.  So how did I miss that call??  Several minutes later my phone rings and it is Verizon in “call back mode”.  I am currently still on hold and have been for 46 minutes (have not spoken to anyone).  I just want to report my landline down.  Why is this so hard to report?

At one point it disconnected from the TV entirely, then it's made games sluggish. Initially thought it was because my devices were low on battery, but I still have issues on a full charge. It's very frustrating especially since late evenings are the only time I can co-op with friends and really unwind. Please fix it.

I don't have a problem that they are fixing a problem.  what I have a problem with is that verizon workers don't tell you anything outside of their script or they are incompetent, verizon doesn't inform them, or verizon just lies to its customers. I have been thinking about going to another network for a while now.  Verizon is so expensive and to get poor customer service that has seriously  put me on the  hunt for a new carrier.

Margate/Pompano Beach Florida has had no service since yesterday at 11am and cannot get anyone on a phone to discuss. The online chat agents knew nothing and wasted 3 hours of my time trying to troubleshoot my phone and selling me things instead of telling me there was a tower outage. This is the most painful experience I have had with a company, except MetLife, and their non-existent customer service.

Way to stop that is them losing customers to companies with better customer care and services

5032844757	2020-08-16T17:12:27	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Service throughout eastern Washington and north Idaho has been down since Wed 8/12. It rotates through No Service, 1X, 3G, LTE every few minutes. Yes, every few minutes!! I can’t get my hot spot connected at all. I’ve not been able to work for days now. I can’t find anything anywhere to give me information about the status of the repairs or to make a report myself. I will be taking a credit for these days and we will be exploring other services very soon. So over this.

5033086645	2020-08-16T20:50:47	darindefer	downdetector	US verizon	Verizon outage in Greenville DE continues after a brief return to service on Friday Aug 14. as of ~midnight Aug 15 the outage of internet and TV continues.  Of the last NINE (9) days we have had service for ONE (1) day.  All other carriers, according to anecdotal information from my neighbors, have been back online for FIVE (5) days already.  Scheduled callback from Verizon support today put me on hold, where I sat for 25 minutes before bailing.  Second callback put me in contact mobile phone support, God knows why, who the assured me that they would hand me off to someone who could help.  They dumped me into the fabulous Voice Response System which ended up in another lengthy hold time before I bailed again.  If there is another carrier out there that is LESS INCOMPETENT than Verizon please let me know and I will switch TODAY.
5033092057	2020-08-16T20:55:54	darindefer	downdetector	US verizon	Does it get better than that? Maybe.  How about a scheduled callback where all they do it put you on hold until you give up.  You wouldn’t think a company could suck and blow at the same time but Verizon support does it!
5033119127	2020-08-16T21:20:58	darindefer	downdetector	US verizon	Getting extremely frustrated with Verizon alternative facts right now. Their web site had previously been reporting that our current outage started at something like 00:08 on Saturday Aug. 15.  Like a fool I didn’t take a screen shot of it.  NOW they claim that the outage started this morning (Aug 16) at 07:59 which is TOTAL BS and I did screen cap in anticipation of the next time they “revise” reality.    Ajit Pai Is the FCC Chairman and a former Verizon legal counsel.  Joe Simmons is the FTC chairman.  Thanks for your great work in advancing communications and consumer protection guys!!! </s>

The most annoying things have been it will drop the keyboard constantly, it switches between apps at lightning speeds kind of like thumbing thru a book, loss of the site I'm on, ESPECIALLY this one.  I have to keep signing back in.  I can hardly email because it keeps closing out.  Also one thing that has gone on since we've been with Verizon is in the evenings, if I want to look at Pinterest it won't load.  Right before this sentence this site disappeared and said lost connection.  We thought Sprint was bad but Verizon is MUCH worse.  We'll be switching soon as well.

In all the poking I reset some things to default.  I am 80, not tech oriented, but had to try something.   It worked!   We had a strong  thunderstorm prior to losing service.

It's always been slow and glitchy, but this week has been exponentially sucky, with my wifi connection dropping every few minutes.  I would gladly switch to FIOS, but Verizon has outright stated that it's not in their economic interests to expand it to my majority-minority community.  I'd even more gladly switch providers, but my only other option is Comcast, which isn't really much of a choice.

5049301600	2020-08-28T20:33:54	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	I can't get the Verizon app to open, so I can figure out my rewards in the worst designed rewards system I've ever encountered. You get a text saying you've got a reward for the month. Pick which one you want. click and it tells you to click to claim, then you have to know that you'll get an email which also tells you to click to use it, but that doesn't actually use it. You have to click again and it applies the gift card to your Amazon account, which you then have to go to see that it's there and remember to use it. Why is this so hard to use? And good luck trying to find the alleged "rewards page" on Verizon. On Verizon where? no indication or hint in the "directions." and the app won't open so if it's there, also good luck finding it.And now you want to get my email and make me log in to comment on this.

Right now, I'm in my apartment with one bar of service, when normally it would have been full. I am not the only person who has been experiencing these issues, even friends and family with Verizon lines have been complaining about the sudden drop. I have been contemplating switching networks lately, as I don't want to be paying for dropped calls, calls where the person cuts out here and there, delayed texts, texts that won't even send, etc.

5060138863	2020-09-06T14:20:38	disqus_uQU8nboD4v	downdetector	US verizon	Is it understood that Verizon is now the worst service provider?  I have not been able to receive a phone-call on my cell phone in my home for weeks - with no end in site.  In addition, my wireless router which was just newly replaced is useless. The service goes in and out by the minute with zero consistency or reliability whatsoever.  Yet, I am paying the same full price to Verizon despite this.  Does anyone have answers as to what is going on.

Restaerting the dam modem how many times??? WHY??? I had DSL for years and I recall not touching the modem for something like TWO YEARS, never had to reboot a thing...ever. And to think as sold out as the service is, they are STILL selling it!!! at a lousy reduced rate BELOW "High Speed" 1-3mbps for new customers. they really need to get off the can on on the stick and get the fios going.

5060490603	2020-09-06T19:55:57	Thresasepulvado	downdetector	US verizon	My niece is with Straight Talk in Pleasant Hill, Louisiana. She and her husband both have been without service since Hurricane Laura came through. She has called straight talk with no results. They told her to call verizon since her phone uses a verizon tower. Verizon told her she has to call straight talk. Help!  Walmart says most people are buying an AT&T phone to use until towers are fixed.
5061133587	2020-09-07T12:31:42	disqus_13CpM64ez6	downdetector	US verizon	I've been with Verizon for 20 years-cellphone.  Within the last few months my calls are getting dropped.  Others with Verizon are having the same issue.  I allowed 7 days for my check to get tto Verizon and it did't hit my account at Verizon, so I paid again via EFTPS.  Either the postal service or Verizon can't keep up. Heads up - for all you conservatives out there, Verizon contributes to Planned Parenthood and other leftists groups.  By my continuing to use Verizon, I'm involved in murdering the unborn.  Guess I'll checkout Patriot Mobile.

They used to be the most awesome. I was able to use my data in eastern Nebraska last night though.

5063888672	2020-09-09T16:20:55	jenifererin	downdetector	US verizon	They won't admit when there's an issue because they don't want to provide widespread credits. However , they will refuse to allow you to talk to an actual human being, charge you $12 if you have to arrange a billing arrangement over the phone bc life , and fee you death over every little thing. Sigh. But hey...they've got the Monopoly and it's not there is a human to complain to . I used to have a lot more respect for Verizon and was willing to pay for the consistency in service ...but now they are quickly becoming no better than Comcast as far as service in my eyes . You'd think with reduced staffing in stores , there'd be increased customer service on the phone ...because they certainly have not cut back our bills.

Have wasted hours with digital assistant and they can't figure it out. Now they tell me to call their tech team, but the number they give keeps bumping me to digital assistant. Staff, via digital assistant, says this is because the digital assistant screen is still open. I close the screen and call again -- to be transferred to digital assistant. When I schedule to be called, the call is dropped. Do I need to get in my car and find a different community/area to get my Verizon phone issues handled? Or just change companies?

Beginning on 9/4, both cell phones have 1 bar in my home.  Calls dropped, failed, or can hear only every third word.  People calling me go directly to voicemail.  Numerous calls to Verizon.  Disconnected a few times.  Told there were no problems, etc.  Several hours lost.  I now have unreliable and horrible service in my own home.  They say nothing changed on their end and I should buy an "extender" for my house to get better cell service.  Trying to sell me more products to improve their service which changed overnight to horrible.  I guess my house somehow moved into a dead zone overnight.  Unbelievable.

I was getting so mad thinking it was just my phone. I was resetting towers, restarting phone, anything lol but after now several days I decided to ask my family if they’ve had any issues and to check their current bars and we’re all at one. It doesn’t seem to be any sort of outage tho?
5070740081	2020-09-14T23:50:28	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	It seems to be an issue with signal strength. I have only been able to get one bar. Not sure when it actually started, but I started to notice about 1-2 weeks ago. Didn’t realize at first because I thought it was just my phone being wacky, then I noticed it always only being 1 bar. And still currently at 1 bar. As are the other 4 people I live with. Does this seem to be what everyone else is experiencing as well? Do you all also have 1 bar? Or low bars?

However if you connect to a vpn first either my work or private I have no packet loss. But say just loading any webpage or streaming without a vpn in place will timeout the first time, then just refresh or try again it will go through. I’m seeing first 2 pings and tracert fail then it will work. It feels like they are failing at implementing new QOS of some sort. My google WiFi daily speed tests are fine. But running network diagnostics will fail the first time, but runs ok the second time. Wait an hour or so and it’s repeatable.

People I call on Verizon while they are on Verizon can't hear me and I can't hear them. The issue seems to be VoLTE (HD Voice) and WiFi Calling. Turning off both of these features on a iPhone fixes the issue. The problem with this is that my Phone on Verizon is a OnePlus 6T, and it's a CDMA-Less device so 2G and 3G don't work while being on Verizon, only LTE, so I can't Turn off VoLTE or the call drops.

5114309115	2020-10-17T21:11:52	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Verizon is having a possible national problem activating new phones.  Specifically iPhone 11 will prompt for account pin that does not match Verizon records.  If you reset your PIN it still won't match.  Too many tries and you will get locked out of your account.  Cannot change any other settings.  Customer support and technical teams cannot get into the account.  Old phone may lose activation.  If you must activate, try setting up phone forwarding and app to handle texting for taking any action as this problem will disable use of the account and ability to receive calls.  Note if you are already in this boat, I was able to set phone forwarding number with the digital assistant once logged into Verizon account even though the web app fails.

5120685295	2020-10-22T17:52:22	disqus_Bc2uqgnC3j	downdetector	US verizon	I'm near Grass Valley in Northern California.  Our service stopped working near my home a few days ago.  Our phones would work in other areas just fine but not at home.  I called/texted Verizon three times and had to go through their HORRIBLE "support" system trying to reach someone.  Each time I was told it was my phone and that their system was working fine.  Those "helpers" were useless!!!  I finally told one that if they didn't connect me with someone who could actually address the information, I was leaving Verizon.  Finally they hooked me up to Tech Support at a fairly high level apparently.  That person was like the old-time Verizon support staff and was a pleasure to deal with.  A ticket was sent out to their Network Engineers who admitted there was a problem that they were working on and that it may be fixed in 3-5 days.   If Verizon continues this ridiculous support garbage path they've started on the past few years, I'm done.
5120687757	2020-10-22T17:54:04	disqus_Bc2uqgnC3j	downdetector	US verizon	The "support" staff at Verizon has told me for a few days there is no problem with their network.  I finally connected with Tech Support after threatening to close my account.  That person sent out a trouble ticket to the Network Engineers.  They finally admitted there's an outage.  It's probably up on Wolf Mountain.  May be 3-5 days before it's fixed.

5133757137	2020-11-01T19:37:08	fadingbubbles	downdetector	US verizon	Is this being done because of the election Tuesday? People cannot protest or connect to go vote if they cannot text or call. Too bad with this administration, you have to even question this but, say too many people are losing service, just when it's time to vote?????
5133779024	2020-11-01T19:56:24	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Landline internet in downtown NYC us down since Tuesday the 27th.

Absolutely scandalous. No way to complain or rush the repair. I refuse to pay for this abominable service. Shame!

5133948916	2020-11-01T22:31:40	anthony_toffenetti	downdetector	US verizon	11/1/20 internet down . I tried calling them but the wait put me at 10 of 5. They told me that it was the wrong department even though i called the number on the site, she also had chickens in the background. The website kept logging me out and is an abomination . The customer support rep in the chat was trying to sell me something every other sentence and clearly did not care about my issue.  Most people are working from home and it is critical that their service gets restored but here i am hanging out with a meeting tomorrow and work i wanted to get done on the weekend. By far the worst customer service ive had. Im likely changing my service to rectum and taking my 200/  family plan to someone else.

5151865240	2020-11-14T21:06:59	stephanieely	downdetector	US verizon	Providence RI  The issues I’ve had with Verizon have been going on intermittently/often since 10/06/2020, but if I think back I started having issues in the summer, just not as often/lengthy. Again no data/texts/internet. I’m typing this and will copy/paste as it probably won’t go through due to no service. It’s been blamed on my device/SIM card. It’s got nothing to do with the device/SIM card, it’s your service. I’ve lost approximately 9 days of work and soon I’ll have lost my job. Take a look at the 5G stuffs you’re installing the timeline of issues  seems to fit, Hoping there’s a company out there that’ll serve as well as they are paid. I’ve been with Verizon 5+ years (after switching from a decade with AT&T) and definitely disappointed in the lack of taking responsibility.

5171163253	2020-11-30T03:02:18	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Spring Hill/Brooksville FL: Verizon/Straight Talk & Visible services - terrible, spotty mobile internet service all day yesterday 11/28. Today 11/29 absolutely no mobile internet at all and now calls/texts are not working either!
5171307124	2020-11-30T07:35:42	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Spring Hill/Brooksville FL: 3 different cellphones - one is Verizon, one is Straight Talk & the other is Visible which also runs on the Verizon network. ALL have had slow to no internet for going on 3 days & now no calls/texting either! No mobile internet most of Saturday. No mobile internet all day Sunday. No mobile internet all day Sunday then no calls/texts either by Sunday night. Now it's Monday almost 3am & my phone is still showing a no service symbol instead of LTE!
5171701336	2020-11-30T16:26:14	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Same here. Brooksville. 6 phones, no service!
5171709389	2020-11-30T16:33:03	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Spring Hill/Brooksville : What is going on with the cellphone connection? I can't call anyone. Are you working on the issue to be fixed? I have some important work related calls to make.
5171723397	2020-11-30T16:44:56	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Apparently it's just Brooksville because service is fine once you get on 589 heading towards Spring Hill Drive. Called Verizon a few times & reps are trying to tell us it's our phones & there isn't any outage here!
5171874315	2020-11-30T18:53:03	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	I was just in Brooksville Fl and could not make a call, had no internet connection and could not text. My husband who was waiting for me to get out of a test couldn’t text or call me and my daughters tablet all on a Verizon plan. I work at the hospital I was getting a test at and so does my husband. We’ve never had issues before, so I find it difficult to believe everything is “fine” and everyone’s phones are the issue.
5171903934	2020-11-30T19:18:15	bevdow	downdetector	US verizon	Same here. Phone worked when I was on 589, now in Brookridge, no service

5171985578	2020-11-30T20:25:32	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	I have been a verizon customer for 20+ years and have always had wonderful service. Very pricey but worth the dependability. For the past 6 months or so things have been going down hill. Since the wee hours of the morning I have had no mobile internet... what is going on?. And making calls and texting is taking forever or not going through at all, God forbid I have an emergency. I have no internet available at my house, I am doing this from work! I looked on the map just now and it's saying the whole eastern seaboard is not working. Wow. My next question are we going to be credited for the service we are obviously not getting? An explanation would be greatly appreciated.
5171986409	2020-11-30T20:26:14	johnathan_dunn	downdetector	US verizon	Ormond Beach, Florida outage & has been all day!
5171998432	2020-11-30T20:36:23	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	Brooksville resident and Verizon customer for years. No service can not keep a call going, constant drop calls once it engages, texting slow. Frustration is at a high level... I cannot do my work without a phone. Please fix this.
5172032222	2020-11-30T21:06:07	adrian_bauza	downdetector	US verizon	Still no service in West Orlando. Goes from 4G to 1x and dropped in the middle of calls. What the hell is going on with Verizon? 17+ years customer and this is the worst I have ever seen it. Reps keep saying they have no reported outages yet here I am. On a site with a load of reported outages. Time to consider switching carriers.
5172056869	2020-11-30T21:27:50	disqus_pO586UTDcC	downdetector	US verizon	Ive had the same issue with my new iphone 12 pro max since it arrived 2 fridays ago.  And they are no help.
5172061694	2020-11-30T21:32:12	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	same same same i think we should all consider leaving verizon. its amazing with all the problems , customer service says everything is fine       they must think we are stupid, maybe we are to keep thinking the service will improve or they actually care.
5172074468	2020-11-30T21:43:59	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	No service in Dunnellon, FL for two days now. Filed multiple tickets and been on and off the phone with them all day and they say “no outages reported”. I’m already building a new plan with a different carrier as I am paying $400 a month and it has been terrible the last few months. Been with Verizon over 15 years but I can’t handle this.
5172087713	2020-11-30T21:56:03	unavailable	downdetector	US verizon	I am in Palm Coast and have had very sporadic coverage all day.  Also an iPhone 12 Pro Max
5172106517	2020-11-30T22:13:24	heather_kraft	downdetector	US verizon	I am in Dunnellon. My step-dad is in my home on hospice. He went in to decline at 4am. I tried calling the on call hospice nurse. My calls were dropped non-stop. Thank goodness I was able to get through enough to tell her what was happening, and we were able to text. This is CRAZY. I just now received texts from the nurse that she sent me this morning. Unacceptable. Then, Verizon puts me through to someone in Asia somewhere who says that he can't help me. NEAT. This same thing happened like 5 months ago too. Is this just a Florida thing?
5172117862	2020-11-30T22:24:05	gailbonnstetter	downdetector	US verizon	Starting last night had 1-0 bars in my condo in Palm Coast - today same and outside now goes from 1-4 bars. I cannot work because of this - please get it resolved asap!

5172397167	2020-12-01T03:36:26	disqus_GpfdP8AUBk	downdetector	US verizon	It’s so ridiculous.  Can’t do anything.  Can’t even use FB or messenger because the message won’t deliver because of the service.  So frustrated.  There are people I need to contact and check on and can’t even do that.  WiFi not even working. They need to fix the damn problem or they’ll be losing a customer.

I work from home and this is my ONLY phone so I'm dead in the water.  Yesterday I had a very important work call and had to get in my car and drive 10 minutes before I got enough cell service for the call.

5172901332	2020-12-01T15:50:56	adrian_bauza	downdetector	US verizon	On day 2 of this shit storm I was finally able to speak to a tier 2 support. They confirmed that even though I am in Ocoee, FL. The outage in Brooksville, Dunedun and Ormond Beach were affecting the tower nearest to my house. No reason other than possible 5G installation at these towers. They advised it should be back up within 24-48 hours! I lost an entire day of work over this.
