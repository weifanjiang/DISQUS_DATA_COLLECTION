4264129940	2018-12-31T22:54:43	disqus_t4zjuFlSEL	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Haines City Florida. Cell service has been out since early this morning.  AT&T website gives no explanation or expected time of restoring services. Local and national news seems to be oblivious to the problem that is affecting most of AT&T, Verizon and other carriers in major cities in the USA. See AT&T outage maps for affected areas. This appears to be a major interruption of service that covers a large portion of the USA yet the public is left wondering.

4265639753	2019-01-02T06:32:22	john_werner	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	No Uverse (so no TV PHONE INTERNET) for the past two days in north Alabama.  NO MOVIES! NO FOOTBALL! NO EMAIL!!! NO HOME PHONE SERVICE!  In minutes I called and reported outage.  I was told it was an area outage and should be fixed by the next AM.  That was a total story.  So I called today and was told it would be fixed by 10 PM (11 EST).  Again nope.  Called again and this time was told it should be restored within 24-hours.  Really?  The worlds best funded communication company can't even communicate the truth about what's wrong with their customers!   This is a total fail by ATT.  I feel about as appreciated as a heel on a worn out shoe.  I'd rather be told a straight believable scenario even if they say it will be a week (no excuse for long outage though as weather wasn't a factor).  I feel sorry for any business needing a phone and a credit card machine depending on ATT.  Glad I jumped ship at my biz over three years ago and haven't regretted it at all.  Stuff like this makes me want to ditch wonky Uverse at my home.  It never lived up to any of the claimed performance in my market anyway.

I'd expect better from AT&T, we've had no outages in the last two years of using AT&T and now when we get one it's a very big outage spread out over 4 days. They should have implemented a mitigation system so if service goes down they can switch everything over to a fallback network until the primary one get's fixed, as having millions of people without internet and cell for days is not exactly ideal. I hope this get's resolved soon because I was in the middle of working on a website this morning when it got shut down and now my project has been delayed.

4316740572	2019-01-31T23:35:02	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Exactly one(1) week without Wi-Fi. DSL has been down for that long and each time I reach out to tech support, they want to sell me on their fiber networks. Your not even giving me the services that I'm currently paying for and you want me to upgrade! Fix my current problem, the one I'm wasting money on. Not only that but my data plan is running over my allotment because I'm trying to continue paying bills, working etc. while my home wifi is down. Btw this is in the Evan's, Ga area. Yesterday I talked with tech support they explained that the outage was because of waiting for a part to come in and that it would be fixed today. It's not up now and its 6:30 pm!

Still no updates and even stopped by an ATT store and they had no idea what was going on.  Seems AT&T has lost control of their infrastructure as well as keeping their stores informed.  I called tech support (which is absolutely LOUSY since they off-shored support) and they said I needed a new router. I tried my backup unit and it too couldn't connect, so wasted over an hour with AT&T for nothing.  Will be calling Comcast tomorrow as I can't afford to have this happen due to my work responsibilities.

Still up in the air as to when internet will return or even what the problem is.  I dropped Comcast for this.  Wow

My modem is connected directly to my isb box, no other wiring connected. I guess I should let them come out every month, I bet they will get tired of that. Why can't they admit their problems. I hav neighbors with AT&T UVERSE and they go down when I go down. Just venting. 7:30 pm, 02/03/19

4322854243	2019-02-05T05:35:17	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I have been having broadband issues today in Detroit MI. First I tried resetting my phone. That worked. Then I had steady green on the Modem but saying connected. But the internet was offline. Did the 15 second unplug. Then the 2 minute unplug. Watching lights blink then steady green and red for awhile. Waiting to see if I get two green again. Interestingly before when I was online it was with one steady and 1 blinking green. Using data and waiting this is annoying. Coming off hassles to get the Internet installed and the billing for no service issues. Suggestion folks. Contact FCC and Washington District Rep and ask them if this is how it's supposed to be for the consumer. The new representatives are not about big business.

Had a so-called upgrade installed on Friday. Saturday uverse went out. Technician arrived Sunday and said it‚Äôs not your equipment on your house it‚Äôs in the box on your street. You will be called in a few hours and they will send out a truck to fix the problem from the street. Complete lie. Nobody came nor called. Calls to support were a joke, including someone telling us that the reason it wasn‚Äôt fixed was because there was no access to our house. We were hone waiting all day. Then when I challenged her on that one she changed her story and said that a crew was outside our house at that very moment. Total bunk. Again I pointed out the lie and she once more changed her story. Utility guy shows up Monday to see where our lines are to be buried and as a courtesy comes in and checks our equipment. He says there is nothing wrong with your equipment. At and T cannot accomodate our schedule. They are supposedly sending someone to fix it on Saturday.   Horrible customer service.

The first time I was down for 5 days. The technician told me the AT&t lineman  accidentally cut some wires. I live in a large apartments complex I checked with my neighbors no issues with AT&t. What are the odds of the lineman only cutting the wire to my apartment who is exposed to hundreds of connections. When I started my service I ask for a higher speed that was available but they told me they could not give me that speed because of the pipeline  was restricted to how much data it could carry. I was the last customer in this complex. To order AT&t internet. How delete my data is like a golf ball trying to find his way through a garden hose not easy.

At first the technician misdiagnosed and sent me a replacement modem. But it‚Äôs still happening. When you call ATT, the automated system says they are aware and there is no need to talk to anyone. There is a problem in the Miramar FL area and they are not being clear with customers. It‚Äôs been way too long, they have to be honest now. Moving to Xfinity.

Obtained a brand-new router/modem, and the situation actually became worse. I have applied all standard troubleshooting methods, and have had no less THREE technicians check inside/outside the house, the pole transmission line, and the "point of entry" boxes that are located 4 blocks from my house. As of this writing I am unable to sustain consistent service for more than a few hours. Then the issues start all over again.  And  I refuse to use AT&T's  "customer service"; something that I would not wish on an enemy...

Businesses are also being affected with Walmart being one example as their systems keep going out and it's disrupting this store and others.   AT&T, get you shit together. This is not acceptable and it's happening more and more. You are costing customers and businesses money. People who PAY you to keep a functioning internet preferably complete with competent staff. One can't even call an expert to have their technical situations resolved because you lot usually hire bottom-of-the-barrel people through outsourcing and refuse to even work on connecting people with those in their own country, let alone even TRAIN them on how to properly advise on how to fix errors.

They scheduled someone to come to my house on Saturday between 4pm and 8pm but said they'd cancel that appointment if the service is restored before then. I work from home and have several meetings this morning that I am the lead on, so I am tethered to my iPad for service right now but it's using up my data so not too happy about it.

4430216214	2019-04-19T17:35:48	j_lister	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Our service has been out since 4-15-2019.  My husband and I were told an outage is in the area.  Daily customer service at at&t said our service would be restored tomorrow.   Tomorrow never came for us.  We asked to speak to a supervisor.   Cody. the supervisor,  told us the outage is over and something is wrong with  the modem.   The $31.00 credit for the length of time of being out of service is a slap in the face.  Cody also gave us the bad news that our modem will not arrive until 4-20-2019.  We offered to pick up the modem here in Austin at one of the at&t center ,but he said it was not possible.  Right now we are very unhappy customers.  Can anyone assist us in getting help today?  Thank you.

Current problems and outages	Yep, they're having problem with moves, add and changes in regards to wireless service. Called yesterday to add a new line of service with a new iPhone I bought from Apple to my account and the customer service rep ended up moving my mother's line to the new iPhone instead. I was pissed. They say they were about to revert my mother's line back to her iPhone 6s Plus SIM and IMEI and now they're having trouble activating the new reserved line they gave me. Result: Mom's number goes straight to voicemail and no service on my new iPhone. Went to the AT&T store this morning and even they weren't able to help. Guess because the system is down and changes can't apply. Looks like I'll be moving to Verizon Wireless. Smh.

4437628389	2019-04-25T15:02:54	theodewitt	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I'm at the ATT page for Boston, MA.  The page for reporting an outage is interlaced with ads, and it quite hard to distinguish the ads from the page itself.  I actually clicked on a clickable within an ad, thinking that clicking on that spot was actually part of reporting process.  Can't remember what the word was, but something neutral, like "click here for info."  Turned out to be an ad for some PDF software.  After I extricated myself from that, the ad that replaced it is some people-finder thing, where you are supposed to enter a name and a phone number.  Again, it looked like something that ATT might plausibly be asking someone to fill out as part of the process of reporting service problems.  Whoever is putting up these ads seems to KNOW what kind of page they are appearing on, and is putting up ads that might plausibly be misinterpreted as being part of the actual ATT page.    And by the way, it sure seems tacky to me for ATT to be putting ads on a customer service page.  Kind of like putting a vending machine in a funeral parlor.

Take cell phones away and people would lose their minds. Cell phones are a luxury item not a need. I pay my bill which I will admit is pretty high but again a luxury. Did it occur to anyone that sometimes stuff happens and that it takes time to travel to the tower as they don't have someone posted there 24/7, figure out the problem, may need a part to fix the problem, wake someone up at that our of the night get to the part, get it to the tower in question and then time to fix it. All while trying to be safe doing it. Rethink your life priorities if your ready to switch due to problems every now and again. Shut off the internet and cell phone towers and you would have a world of chaos. Thank you AT&T for getting to the problem and fixing it as fast as you safely could. There are those ofnus out there who appreciate the efforts that late at night. Hope you got some good overtime for it to help your families.

4459150003	2019-05-12T02:20:49	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	All TV and Amazon Prime and some Netflix went out last night (10th May) around 7pm.  Wi-Fi remained active then and since.   This happened just after a notice appeared that AT&T needed to make a network change which required a reset on the WPS and WAP.     Shutdown was automatic but the system didn't come back active.    Spent 3 hrs on the on-line help to the usual of resetting WPS, etc. but system never came up, and then on-line chat with an agent and then with supervisor who had us do the same things that we had already done during on-line refresh of system and even before going on-line.     Instructed us to do more questionable fiddling and first agent finally concluded that it was the wireless receiver that was bad and that they would have to FedEx us a new one but that one wouldn't arrive until Tuesday  (i.e., meaning being without internet service for 4 days.    We requested some quicker option so we were then transferred to a supervisor (Trevor).    Initial agent and supervisor had deep english names though they were likely not real names given the poor english writing and grammar and continued problems with understanding simple requests to resolve the issue.   Trevor finally said that we would have to contact UPS and gave us a link to UPS but nothing else (made no sense) and then he promptly cut the chat off. This didn't seem to be an equipment issue from the start, and the first contact representative and the supervisor didn't appear to be competent to do basic assessment of the problems.     Calls to AT&T have been substantial during the past 24hrs, which also seemed to b e related to the system update excercise.   The AT&T agents presented as incompetent from the start, and just didn't care.     Going to terminate service with AT&T within next few days.

Current problems and outages	I want to report 4g outages in Pontiac Michigan near the Notre Dame prep school right off Walton. I have had At@t for 3 years now and never had an issue with 4g but in the last week data has been slow probably less than dialup speeds. Now I had called At@t numerous times over this issue and they deny it is a tower problem nor can they send a technician to fix the problem until they get more complaints. I have two different model phones that are doing the same thing so I know it is not the phones. If anyone living in this area is having the same issue please call At@t costumer service and make a complaint so the problem can get resolved they need so many ticket numbers or complains before they do anything.  Also I will add this issue seems to happen the most between 10 Am-and 2P.M  I know for a fact this is not network congestion causing the issue unless someone is misusing At@t 4g data services to download major data packets which would bog down the system and which is also against At@t TOS.

(This is not the same as simply logging in to a nearby WiFi Connection for internet surfing.)  In your iPhone settings (most phones have similar wording and options) click on "Cellular", then click on "Wifi Calling" and click on "Wifi Calling on this Phone" and then accept the disclaimer if one pops up. Whenever ATT is down or lagging the phone will automatically utilize the nearest available WiFi. Same goes with people on other phone services. Get over it people, crap happens, either deal with it or get left behind.

After the first guy came out Saturday that verified it wasn't my connection, they said a technician would be out later that day. If they did, they didnt do anything. Called, they were supposed to come out first thing today. Nothing. Called again, apparently there's no way to figure out when the technician might have the internet fixed, or to even confirm it's actually being worked on, until Tuesday when their dispatch center reopens.  Last time this happened (about a year ago) it took nearly a month to get service. A month I paid for internet and I didn't get any internet. Forget something free, I just wanted my payment back, or to not pay my bill the next month. I barely got 2 weeks. I hate ATT. After years of being forced into comcast because of my location, and their slow and constantly out service, I thought I'd made the right choice when I moved somewhere that offered comcast and ATT. Nope. Do better ATT.

4487671168	2019-06-03T15:21:26	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Hi Jason,  I'm not associated with AT&T at all (other than also being a customer with the 1000mbps plan), but the reason you're not reaching 1000mbps is probably due to the hardware you're trying to download/upload with. For example, even if I have "access" to 1000mbps, my PS4 or my Laptop that was made in 2015 is a limiting factor since they will only download content at about 70-100mbps in an absolute optimal setting.  Long story short, if you bump down to the next lowest tier plan you probably wouldn't notice a difference in quality and would save a few bucks every month. Hope this explanation helped!

I have no idea if or when someone sends a text. This has greatly interfered with my work and personal life.  When i ask At&t, they don't seem to know what the problem is...but they sure know how to accept my $130 payment every month and remind me that I am not eligible for an upgrade in my phone or services. So sick of them. My daughter's fiance has At&t also, and when he comes to visit us, he suddenly has no service either! How can they get away with charging for a service they cannot provide??!?!?

It‚Äôs awesome when you switch your work schedule to set a time with them only for them to do unprofessional things like this.

I had to call every other day because I was not contacted as I was told I would be the next day to let me know how they‚Äôre going to fix this issue. I do a lot of work at home as well, and this is just killing me.... that I have to leave to do work errands elsewhere.   They‚Äôre telling me they will credit me for the the time of the outage???

Can't download files for 2 days. Critical updates can't be retrieved. They just drop out while downloading because the connection is so slow.  What a mess.  Speed tests to all peering points are showing less than 1 meg downstreams.  The biggest problem is ATT's unwillingness to communicate with the customer.  If they are having network issues they should let the public know so customers don't have to wait on calls to customer service. Customer Service is nasty at ATT.  Two hours on the phone today with rude unprofessional reps that don't know their job so they take it out on the customer.  We need our Lawmakers to end this monopoly of areas by all carriers so that customers have options and choices. This is America right !

No hello - how can I help. Woman was abrupt, unhelpful - no useful info. I guess, after ten years with ATT, I am forced to find another carrier next week. Horrible customer service.

The office is still in the same place, the service interruptions started and are increasing. This seems to be a problem all over the country. The inter/disruptions may be something that is goin on in the various layers of the  atmosphere. That concerns me even more

Most of the AT&T employees seem to just don‚Äôt care about our business. So difficult to deal with. If is was not for one local AT&T employee trying to help us I would change and that is a shame after being an Complete AT&T customer for over thirty years. Maybe time for a change since they seem to don‚Äôt care about the small business.

4520039230	2019-06-28T20:51:23	linde_l	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Since Thursday 6/27/19 ~ 7 pm (approximately 20 hours, not sure exactly when it started), we have lost cellular service for the most part. Every now and then we will see 1 or 2 bars then it goes away. I saw H (for HSPA) for about 10 seconds when I went outside and later it displayed LTE for about a minute outside, but for the most part, there are 0 bars of service and no data, definitely no service inside. Normally we get 2 bars downstairs, 3-4 bars with LTE upstairs, and 4 bars with LTE outside. We have reported this outage via AT&T chat, DownDetector, AT&T community forum, and AT&T's Facebook account. Got the usual "is your phone up to date", etc. questions, but with 3 completely different phones, that's not it (iPhone, Moto x4, Nokia Lumia 635). As I click, I see 1 bar for the first time in an hour.

Called AT&T but was told it might be my fault as they don't see any outages in my area. After explaining to the gentleman "Monroe" if that was even his damn name that I'm not a complete imbecile I questioned him to look into the main hub that my internet lines connect to. He stated that there are 5 other households using the same port and connection as me all with tickets submitted for no internet service and 15 other ports in the terminal were 100% down. I asked him if they were sending someone out to check the box and he said that it would be a HIPAA violation to tell me yes or no. He then told me he put me on an urgent request and I'd hear from someone soon before hanging up. I got a text confirming the appointment he setup for me next Tuesday during my work hours. I'M ABSOLUTELY LIVID.

(Thanks for making me wait for nothing) I work and go to school from home. My complaint is not that I can't watch Netflix and chill.  I have critical applications I need running and I am behind deadline. If AT&T cannot keep service running, they should at the least be honest and reimburse for down time. **Located in North Texas.

I would think a multi- million dollar company would have this resolved by now! Numerous local customers of AT&T have enough issues as it is with service in this area, and I would think at this point AT&T would, and already should have made it a priority to ensure better service in the West Texas Area. There are numerous accidents that occur in the oilfield and most locations have zero service as soon as you get just a few miles outside of town! UNACCEPTABLE!  AT&T PUT MORE TOWERS UP AND HAVE BACK UP TOWERS FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS THAT DESPERATELY NEED SERVICE IN OUR AREAS! I think our bills are high enough monthly and we don't have good service as it is, so maybe you should put all of that money towards some towers in West Texas..you may even help emergency personnel find crash victims sooner..you may even help save some lives!

My phone doesn't work at either location.... for WEEKS. Keep being told there's no towers down, etc. I can't send messages, get online, literally nothing. For how much we pay for these ridiculous devices I feel an answer/resolution is the least I should get. My phone consistently says "no service" or "can not activate cellular service" and there's only greyed out bars, one bar is the most I get which is rare but still doesn't work. and the best is when the 4G logo just outright disappears. Just so frustrated. Left Sprint for "better service". There's some irony if I ever heard of any.

Current problems and outages	Starting yesterday 7-18-19 all four of our iphones have NO SIGNAL INSIDE HOUSE-no calls can be made and no calls received. We are in Tyler TX near Chapel Hill.  People who call us say it goes straight to voice mail.  I had to drive down the road just to get a signal back on to make a phone call!  We have lived here for 15 years and always have at least 1 bar of signal. We do live next to a cell tower so our service has only been 1 bar since we are so close.  AT&T service technician said the service goes out like an umbrella and if you are too close to the cell tower it shoots out right over you.  But even with this we have ALWAYS HAD SERVICE UNTIL YESTERDAY INSIDE OUR HOUSE.  If I walk down the driveway or out into my back yard the 1 bar of service comes back on and I can make a phone call.  I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE CELL SERVICE ON 7-18-19 AND AT&T NEEDS TO MAKE A REPAIR.  I've tried to report it through a chat online since I can't call out.  The techs have no clue.  They keep having me reboot and restart my iphoneX but that doesn't fix it because it has nothing to do with my cell service inside my house.  HELP!

But what really aggravates me is that I had to go somewhere else to find this out, we use AT&T for everything and you would think they would have some kind of alert or message or something saying the network is down.....??? Instead I have been accusing my wife of not paying the phone bill correctly! I have had too many problems with AT&T both Wi-Fi and cellular, for the second biggest phone carrier you would think they would have better operations and procedures in place to alert people when there is an outage. I bought the 1000 Wi-Fi from AT&T and had nothing but problems since day one!  I can still only connect at about 32 megabytes a second it took an Act of God to get someone out here at all, in fact, when you call AT&T (India) you basically get treated like you are an idiot or accused of lying.... and then when you finally do get a technician to come out he has no idea what he is doing and can't answer simple questions about the router or the network. And for all of the trouble that you have to go through what do you get? Nothing, not even an apology. You would think maybe they would give you a credit or something, not these days! You should be allowed out of your contract automatically after so many problems, I am getting ready to go regardless, it is more trouble than it is worth, all of it.

They have had enough time to repair or replace everything by now. There were minor outages of 2 or 3 days before this but 25 days is unthinkable. When you call and jump through all their hoops, finally a recording will give you a recorded fairyland date and precise time they expect to have service restored. When that time passes the only thing they do is replace the recording with a new fairyland date and time. How can they expect me to pay their bill which, by the way, was higher this month than ever. The one time I did get to speak to a warm bodied human, barely intelligible English, they couldn't find my phone number in their records. I was speaking to him on this very phone number, that we have had since early in 1978. For me it's time for a change.

AT&T you suck do your job or we are all going somewhere else.

It's fire season up here in No. Cali, ( remember last years devastating CARR & CAMP fires? ). AT&T better pray BIGTIME that we don't have another (with no cell service), the CDF Alerts to Evac will be non-exsistant!!

So no cell/internet service until SEPT! (if that). Not acceptable!! ** </b></u>    One positive note, the maps shows you "exactly" where the cell towers are (near you). Good to know, might want to take note. One never knows, you may need to know it in the future.

Current problems and outages	ANSWER:   <u>Merger Synergies and Debt Reduction:</u>   The company expects total WarnerMedia synergies to reach a run rate of $2.5 billion by the end of 2021. About $1.5 billion will be cost synergies, including efficiencies in marketing and procurement functions and corporate overhead. The remaining $1 billion are revenue synergies expected from additional sales opportunities, lower subscriber churn and higher advertising. The company expects to reach a run rate of about $700 million by the end of 2019, increasing to $2 billion by the end of 2020 and ramping to $2.5 billion by the end of 2021.<u><b> AT&T expects to end 2018 with a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of about 2.8x, which it plans to reduce to the 2.5x range by the end of 2019, implying an $18 billion to $20 billion reduction in debt.</b></u> The company expects to use about $12 billion in free cash flow after dividends to pay down debt in 2019. It also expects to generate cash of at least $6 billion to $8 billion from other opportunities, including real estate sale-lease backs, sales of non-core assets and working capital initiatives.   <u>Mobility:</u>   The Mobility business unit represents nearly half of AT&T‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA and about 40% of its revenues. The company expects Mobility to continue to deliver top- and bottom-line growth. <u><b>Mobility is growing both service revenues and EBITDA and will continue to do so in 2019. The company expects its leadership in 5G and its FirstNet deployment will help sustain this growth. The company announced today that it has launched LTE-LAA technology ‚Äî with theoretical peak speeds of up to 1Gbps ‚Äî in 31 markets across the United States.</b></u> The company has the best wireless network in the United States, according to GWS.

Came home tonight to find a post downstairs in lobby of Condo building (Glenlake Condos in Chicago) that there is an outage until Mon or Tues! I'm tolerant of a day outage but 3-4 days of total outage is ridiculous especially if you have the bundle phone/comp/tv. Please at least provide further details and updates to your customers. I'd appreciate more explanation than just sorry it may be 3-4 days until service back.

4589625206	2019-08-24T00:58:06	disqus_CAXShDtgpX	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	UVerse TV was down 8/22/19 in Orlando around 7:30PM. It seemed to be going down in "package-chunks" -- the baseball games were gone first, then other sections like movies, until soon all channels were gone.  After several useless reboots which the TV-message said to try, we called AT&T. We were on hold for at lest 20 minutes before even being able to get through to a customer service rep. While on that hold, the automated recording said that the lines were busy due to an unusually high call volume. When this call-volume issues was mentioned, the online service rep said it was OUR actual system that was having a problem however, NOT the network (???). He tried several methods to get our connection back, but failed. He then set us up for a tech to come out to our house --- but the earliest time would be 8/24-Saturday!! When we woke up the Friday morning, we found that the TV service had been magically restored!! We did not bother calling AT&T since we had already spent over an hour of our time on the phone with them the previous night‚Ä¶  We finally had a phone call Friday evening from that same AT&T service rep. He said that it HAD been a wide-area outage, and so a tech would not be needed to come out....! He mentioned that our system appeared to be connected & working again from his test-program‚Ä¶but to call back to them if we had ongoing or new problems arise. So--------do they purposely keep their phone Service Reps in the dark about what is happening, or do they actually expect people to not find out that they were right --- "high call volume" + sudden loss of signal = ATT service outage !!!???!!!??? Dear ATT -- people do NOT like to be lied to, or called dumb, etc etc etc PS - Our Internet & Phone were both working yet.

The only time they can send out is a repairman is 8am to 12pm. So unless you can afford to take off from your job - you‚Äôre not ever going to get your internet fixed. I kept asking her to check each months schedule for a time after 12pm. We got to three months in advance of the rep saying all the after 12pm appointment times were taken before she admitted finally that they don‚Äôt even offer people service times after 12pm. So I told her since I can‚Äôt afford to take off work I‚Äôm just cancelling their service. Unbelievable! Their service breaks and they will not allow service times for working people? Good riddance.

4609987323	2019-09-09T18:09:41	arnieplathe	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I have used AT&T Prepaid on my Moto G6 smartphone throughout the Midwest without any issues for approximately a year and a half.  About May of 2019 I (and many others) started having low signal issues on a regular basis here on Brass Parkway in Rosemount MN 55068.  Within the past several months, my phone has become virtually useless indoors as the signal is so poor that I can seldom make or receive calls.  I have repeatedly reported the problem via the AT&T "mark the spot" app but AT&T has been non-responsive.  The local AT&T stores including the one in Apple Valley MN are clueless and, as importantly, disinterested in providing any contact information for AT&T that might help resolve the problems.

4612237974	2019-09-11T14:32:44	disqus_TBreNUbEwa	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I live in a town of about 500 people (at the most) 20 miles south of Shreveport, LA. We have not had cell service or internet since 1:30 pm on 09/07/2019. It is now 09/12/2019. AT&T has lied to me on numerous occasions, even going as far as saying they pinged our cell phones to a different tower so that we would have service. She then put me on hold to ‚Äúcall‚Äù both of my sons and my mother to see if it was working. Each time she ‚Äúcalled‚Äù, she would come back on the line and say it worked. How dare they lie to me about the safety of my children and my mom!!! I have screenshot after screenshot of AT&T saying that the service would be back on the next day. This began Friday, 09/07/2019. Each day, it says it will be fixed the next day. Since all the major carriers use AT&T‚Äôs towers out here, no one‚Äôs phone or internet is working! AT&T has U-Verse 4 miles to the east of me and 6 miles to the south (that I know of) and we only get fixed Wireless. It is used with the tower, so we don‚Äôt have internet either! No one in Keatchie can even call 911 if they have an emergency and we are already about 25 miles from the nearest hospital! They keep saying they have people physically working at the tower but yet every time I drive by there, no one is there. Also, each student in our parish receives a chrome book for the school year to access their books and do their homework. My children have not been able to do their homework since Thursday. Also, I have lost about $1000 in contract work since this happened because I conduct presentations online. I am just praying no one passes away because of AT&T‚Äôs negligence due to the fact we are in the middle of a September heatwave. It was 103 degrees yesterday and the humidity made the heat index around 112 in the shade! If anyone has any advice, please let me know!!! We are desperate down here. They don‚Äôt care about a little bitty down like mine. Thank you!

I had to call 911 to report incident (still ongoing as of 7:50pm; 9/16/18), as ATT was worthless after I attempted several different ways to report outage only to keep getting customer service-who kept trying to get me to buy services. Amateurs. 911 said they would send a patrol car over to assess what was going on. ATT should b ashamed of the runaround they gave me while trying to contact the hospital and then while trying to report the outage incident. It‚Äôs one thing to BS an individual but a hospital system. üëé

This is causing major issues and I am using my MiFi device to be able to work, you should be dealing with medical facilities and creating an action plan, it is not safe to be out this long.

4632737975	2019-09-28T19:20:50	allanbadiner	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	My TV is down with a persistent code 775 since Sept 26, 2019. I have a service contraxt with ATT and despite that I have waited at home for repair appointments ( ) 4 times (each period for appointments is 4 hours long-- that is 16 hours of actual waiting. After the fact, I'm told by "supervisors" a series of excuses for the no-shows: that I was not home (untrue); that the gate on my drivway was locked (untrue), and that I really didnt have an appointment today (also untrue). Apparently,  just the service rep and I thought we had scheduled ithe last appointment.  The location from which the repair people come from seems to be unaccountable for their serious malfunctioning resulting in the shocking inconvenience of waiting by my front door for 16 hours cumulatively and never seeing a repairman. Now I'm told the next appointnent is really scheduled and confirmed for September 30, 2019 but you might be able to imagine why I have very little confidence that this will happen.

The location Gateway log says the service restoration was 2146 tonight, the outage wasn't properly recorded by the Gateway. I reported the outage and ATT confirmed it at approx 1014. So 11:32 down due to a line break? No idea or official explanation as to what the real cause was, why t took so long to fix and how many homes were affected.

It would be sooo much easier to work thru this if there were more English speaking service folks.  After about 6 hours of trying over 3 days of calling to reach someone whose dialect I could understand , they all said that this is a result of a large system failure and patience is required on our part.  I was half tempted to do a factory reset on my #10+ and lose everything on my phone, but I chilled out a bit and will wait until Friday to act next.  Let me know if you have any success in restoring your voicemail please, and I will do the same.  Thanks

4645365759	2019-10-09T00:13:16	publius_maximus_III	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	No voicemail access for my AT&T wireless phone the past 5 days. When I call voicemail, after a 10-sec delay a recorded message comes on saying: "Sorry. The service you have requested is not available at this time. Please try again later..." and then it hangs up!   Called AT&T for the umpteenth time Mon night (10/7/19). Spoke to a Tech with a Latina accent somewhere in the Philippines. She put me on hold and spoke to their "Back Office" which told her an "enhancement" would be rolled out in the next 24-48 hours that would fix the voicemail problem. Well, 24-hours so far and nothing. On an earlier call Sunday, a different Tech had told me about 300,000 AT&T customers were having the problem, some dating back to Sept. 21st. Said their engineers were "working on it."   Guess I'm one of the "lucky" ones -- only been without voicemail for 5 days. My wife and I share an account and her voicemail has been working fine the whole time.

Current problems and outages	For a company that boasts about how great they are AT&T really needs a reality check. Employees and technicians of AT&T have Verizon and or Xfinity accounts at their own homes. I am switching my service, I have given AT&T their last chance. Within the last week I had one of their tech's come to the house and perform an upgrade. It worked for about a minute. I even caught him in the driveway before he could leave telling him it was out again. He said "Sorry, I already closed the ticket, you will have to schedule again for another technician to come back out"  WTF?  You are here in my driveway and now I have to reschedule according to AT&T's schedule and then wait around for another worthless technician to poke at some wires. Its no wonder people are turning to Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV and the rest.  These ass clowns really do suck!

4647627342	2019-10-10T19:20:18	publius_maximus_III	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Latest update from Tech Support: AT&T has been having major problems with its Charlotte servers going back to Sept 21st. I've only had a problem with access to my voicemail since Oct 4th. One reason may be fixes implemented since 9/21 have been affecting other customers negatively. I've made the decision this afternoon to have my voicemail moved to a new server. This means any messages on my old voicemail account will be lost, including any I have never accessed -- that along with any existing voicemail settings or greetings. Because of the server problems, AT&T is unable to access my account either, to determine just how many heard and unheard messages I currently have. So switching to a new server can't be any worse than things are right now, since there is NO estimate of when the problem will be fixed on the old server, if ever. The longer I wait, the more (potential) messages I may never get to listen to from this point on. Tech says that I will be contacted by an AT&T rep within 24-48 hours, once the voicemail server move has been completed. Crossing my fingers.

4650192024	2019-10-12T23:25:59	wise_son	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Yes a problem here Wilmington Delaware 19805 etc. Speeds slower than Verizon and only one or two bars. Thats awful Especially since I'm Almost in the prOcess of porting my number from Verizon. I paid 300.00 for the 1 year to have the 25/m plan. First I bought a sim to test att out and it was great for two days then this happens.  Also Verizon actually tOld me Is was issues on my line and it wasn't set up correctly on my account and that's why I was having issues with Verizon in the 1st place. But I found that out after I bought the 300 plan from att. So anyway my Verizon phone is working  great now with 4 bars And fast speed Too.  And att is awful right now.  So they switched places. Lol  Dilima Dilima. I'm glad I didn't activate the att sim yet because they shouldn't take the money out the bank until the sim is activated. So I don't know if this is a sign for me to keep Verizon or what. Anyway I'm giving the service a chance to be fixed before I go through with it. Drum roll for stay with Verizon Or continue the port to go with att.  Verizon is 35/m 16gb and att is a flat 300 for the yr (25/m) for only 8 GB. I'm thinking to just stay with Verizon since they may have fixed the issue. IDK  So far I paid 55 bucks on att Sims and a plan to test att. I done the math. But still don't know which way to go yet.

Switched to ATT in May, was great until late September, now the same issues. Are these carriers being hacked?

It was sent out 9/20/2019 and gave the following explanation: "Hi AT&T Yahoo Mail member, Good news! There‚Äôs a new way to set up your AT&T email account in email apps that will keep your information even more secure. Please update or upgrade your email apps IMMEDIATELY. Failure to do so will interrupt your access to your email account." Don't know about you, but sounds to me like AT&T was getting hacked through their email interface with Yahoo-DOT-com. Anyway, I followed the directions and replaced my Outlook mail password with the Secure Mail Key generated in my AT&T account and now I don't have access to voicemail. Coincidence?

The regulatory burden put on telecoms is explicitly prohibitive. It's intended to keep the bigs in, and everyone else out...and that is why our service sucks. Because the system is set up specifically to make it that way. Without such regulations, we'd be able to compete with them, and develop better telecom protocols/hardware. It's worked in cryptocurrency, so I'm pretty sure it will work with telecoms too.  -Oz

4668743136	2019-10-28T15:03:17	disqus_V6OjBtpLHU	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Dumped service after latest connection issues. P@ss poor off shore customer service is a joke. Have a billing issue? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!  ATT continued to charge me for direct tv service even though direct tv sent me a final bill months earlier. It took me almost 4 months and 4 different stories from ATT. Placing a credit to the account couldn't be done they said because I had already cancelled direct TV. That excuse made no sense as ATT was who kept charging me for a service already cancelled. I was told a credit would hit account within 48 hrs. It did not the next story was it will auto hit the account at the end of billing cycle, it did not. I was then told a check would be mailed in 7-10 days. It was not. I was then told they don't send checks under $200 they said it would be on a prepay card and I should have it in 10 days. It was not. Finally around day 26 a prepay card showed up $16 less than my emails indicate the credit was supposed to be for. Avoid like the plague...

Current problems and outages	NO phone for days- despite showing full bars- Apparently, a new tower is being built and multiple ones being repaired- Customer service advises should be repaired today- No one seems to have any information; can advise why AT&T customers were not notified of issue-but rather left to flounder with no phone service (there fore NO connectivity or protection) when traveling- let alone as your ONLY source of contact at home- So, on top of that, I was told I would have to call back if I wanted to be reimbursed or credited for the days of no service- Best part? CS asked if I wanted to add a land-line for $19.99 a month- NO! I‚Äôd like to get the service that I currently pay for and NOT give you more money for a service I already pay nearly $300 a month to receive! Classy AT&T. I‚Äôm about to change providers after nearly 16 years of loyalty- Ridiculous.

The past two weeks have been extra terrible. I cant even load FB feed sometimes. Not sure whats going on but I understand maintenance and problems will always occur but its been wayyy too long with these issues now. a few months is kinda bad.

You would think this problem would be resolved considering this has gone on for years.  I've had this landline for 17 yrs, but this is the last time I'm going to go days on end without a line that I depend on.  I know that it boils down to not wanting to put the money into to get it done.  And my bill keeps going up.  At this point I should be credited for all the days I've not had service!

On top of that, they are using copper not fiber optics and lower performance / speeds and the intermittent outages impacting my business ..

Well the new modem is in & I still don't have internet. Every day it's a coin toss to guess if my connection is working. Every time I call, someone tries to sell me another service or more hardware, but fail to acknowledge that they need to upgrade or repair their lines or hardware.  Chattanooga, TN has fast public internet for $30.00/mo & it rarely goes down. The rest of us pay double & triple for AT&T's  garbage service. Why can't we have what Chattanooga has? Because  AT&T & Comcast lobbied the TN lege to stop other cities from getting public wifi so the rest of us suffer while AT&T puts profit over customers.  They say they're capitalists but they don't want competition. They kill competition by buying our state legislators to kill competitors.

After 3 months and SEVEN appts, they were a no-show/no-call FOUR TIMES for scheduled installation after I took off work 4x for instal of phone/internet/U-VerseTv. Finally got everything installed today. Also will be CANCELING all of the services I got today. They never mentioned I had to get a new home phone #....so I was gonna live with that. Then AFTER they installed the 100 mbps internet, the installer says the highest I can get is 50 mbps. Again.....I was gonna live with that as well. Then the ONE station I was told that comes with my package that I wanted was NFL Network. In the guide the tech left me, it says station 1630. I turn it on and it says this isnt available as of recently with UverseTv. Really??? I waited 3 months for this?? Spoke to a manager and guess what they offered me?? The phone number to cancel all of ATT services! What a joke! Will def be going back to Cox Cable by tomm.

4708235274	2019-12-01T13:31:32	robertherrageii	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	AT&T service has been down since the early A.M. on Friday, 11/29/19 in my area 36526, specially at my place. Nothing has worked in re-establishing connection and calling AT&T has been as waste of time. No one at the company is honest. Everytime I call I get different pieces of information and am treated like my problem doesn't matter to the company I am paying for poor internet service. I do not recommend their services to anyone unless you want to be taken advantage of by being robbed of your own money for service that doesnt work and for customer service that treats your problem like "no big deal". There should be bill refunds for outages and customer treatment like this, but does AT&T care, no. It's sad to read all the other comments about management hanging up on customers and not calling them back; the incompetence of maintenance workers cutting lines and wires causing outages, and customers spending hours on the phone only to wind up where they started. Get your crap together AT&T and do the right thing. Stop stealing people's money and hire workers who KNOW what they are doing. Start treating your customers like they are valuable to your job security instead of naive and stupid idiots.

4708430153	2019-12-01T17:23:07	usn61	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	This what happens when the government gets involved with private corporations. The government filed antitrust charges against AT&T and broke up the company because they felt it was a monopoly. Before that AT&T and its subsidiaries, Bell Telephone Labs a world renown research facility, all seven Operating companies and a manufacturing unit, Western Electric were providing top notch, innovative communication services and products. Bell Labs alone was filing patents on a daily basis. They pioneered cellular technology which is used now throughout the world.     I'm currently visiting my family in Missouri where they have AT&T internet services and have a wireless router which signal drops in all rooms where the router is not located. If you are in the basement it drops by more then half!! On top of that I've noticed that they appear to throttle streaming services at certain periods which they have been caught doing numerous times.

I‚Äôve just come home from a very long day at work and now this. The internet service drops when it rains or if it‚Äôs windy outside.

Attempts by ATT to help me reset my password are not working and I am not able to log into my email account. An Att Manager said her "Yahoo Escalation Rep told her it was a server outage, though the initial rep I spoke to prior to her saw no issue with the server and said the email account was in good standing (ie: not blocked due to some spammer Hijacking it to send spam mail from.). THen I had a very wierd experience with the ATT Manager, a woman named "Ann" who became frustrated when I asked her for more detail such as  * Was this a large outage or local? (She never answered clearly) * Can I get an email or call back or case number when the server is up again. She said the case number is private and for internal purposes only; then said the Yahoo Escalation Team would call me when up again, and then she litteral hung up or the call was disconnected. I was shocked. * I discovered the problem only when I called to inquire about billing and expired rate promotion..email was working fine until yesterday and until I called about the non-related issue. * FYI the rep tried to help me reset a sub account email with a new pw, and though it seemed to reset, after creating my new password, it still would not let me into my email. * Also, on 123019 I discovered a sub-account to my main email account with them I didn't recall creating. I wasn't too worried because I have serveral sub accounts I haven't used much over past few years, and figured it was something created for a project at one time, I was forgetting. I would follow up for time demands later. I attempted to reaccess the email and reset the password there also, but it is also not working to the ATT reps surprise. / end

Current problems and outages	San francisco, 94121 5 dropped calls in 7 minutes and i did not change physical location or body position...happening for several days. Goes from 4 bars to no bars to antenna symbol.  constantly get "NO SERVICE" while dialing, answering a call or on a call. Happens when I'm trying to reach tech support at 611. My phone is fine...not a phone problem.  I pay my bill so I must be stupid.  Two words for you ATT Wireless and they are not "happy birthday".  it's pretty stupid to not maintain your service in a place like San Francisco with so many tech industry people here.  have you ever heard of reputational risk?  Your CEO and executives are shit.  Time-warner?  Stupidity.  You care about your stock buybacks to juice EPS for executive bonuses. You have perverse incentives and you slam people all the time.  Class action on the way.  I worked on the VISA-MASTER CARD Class action and i know which Manhattan law firm to contact.  it's going to be very juicy class action. PUC, FCC, FTC, Commercial fraud dept. of local DA and state atty general being notified in CA, TX, (Dallas), NY and Delaware.  Cnn, ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, local and national media outlets being notified as well as all of your institutional investors. I worked on wall street and know just what to do.  Enjoy your karma. Every entity will be cc'd on my report so everyone sees all those being notified.  Happy new year.

Spend almost 2 hours with AT&T tech support on phone, with transfers to 4 people before being told there was an AT&T TV outage.  No estimate for the outage to be resolved.  Interesting as I can access and watch AT&T TV via their APP on my smart TV, but not through their remote receiver device. Very disappointed and frustrated with this product.  Anybody broke their contract for non performance.  I am ready for cable tv or DISH.

4748259053	2020-01-07T14:12:27	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	AT&T TV streaming service has been down since 1/6/2020 morning. After calling, because phone app wouldn't work, and being placed on hold for an hour and a half, I was told there was an outage in Wichita and they were working on it. I also logged into the chat on my PC and that was a joke. I went through 4 people who had no idea what they were doing or could tell me if there was a problem. This morning, 1/7/2020, I'm in a chat via the myATT app (now working as I reported it also) and have been told "at this moment we have not yet been provided an exact time frame as to when this is going to be resolved due to this issue still being worked on'".  I've asked them to adjust my bill accordingly and suggest every ATT customer do the same! Service just came back on at 8:05am. Switching to AT&T is a mistake! Don't do it. Customer service is horrible. I spent over 15 hrs on the phone with them when installing TVs. Technician had to come out on multiple occasionsas well. I could go on and on...

It‚Äôs now 9:30 AM the following day and Service is still out. I am beyond ticked.  This service is awful.  It‚Äôs inferior to the service we had with U-Verse. I‚Äôve made a list of 10 things so far of ways in which it‚Äôs inferior to U-Verse. I wish to God I had never switched.

We have 4 bars for about 30 seconds, then no bars for several minutes.  The pages load so slowly it is reminiscent of DIAL UP days.  We have had the SIM card replaced so it's not that.  It has to be the tower and the amount of customers on that tower.  We live 7 miles from the city limits and have clear sight to the ATT tower, but the internet service is slower than molasses... and if I want to watch a movie on Demand??? HAHAHAHAHA     It took me over 3 hours  to watch a 2 hour movie due to buffering.  I have to start the movie, then let it "pause" for half an hour, then I can watch up to 45 minutes before I have to let it buffer again.  ATT can do MUCH better, I am sure!

One rep actually told me that workers just completed the repairs and I'd have service "within minutes". Well that was 2 days ago. Another rep lied and said there was no problem with my area.

I usually don't do stuff like this but this is my own way to vent being that I cannot get a real person on the phone. Like I said AT&T is garbage...!!!

Current problems and outages	Tuesday a little before noon internet went down for 200+ customers here in north McKinney, near Prosper.  I've spoken with multiple people and nobody at AT&T has a clue when it will be fixed.  I heard a cable was cut but I did some research and that should take about 4 hours to fix.  Were past 75 hours with no internet.  Luckily I have Verizon wireless with unlimited data or I'd be really screwed as I've worked from home for years.     The sad thing is that they do know how long it will take, they must after this long, but they're not saying because they know more people will leave.  I'm switching to Spectrum if it's not resolved this weekend.

They of course tell me the connection is bad (obviously, that is why I'm calling) and inevitably hang up on me. No better luck online. You would think that a company this large would do a better job, especially when most of the country is quarantined at home. Cell service is the only way to communicate. 3 days of this is ridiculous.

I am supposed to be working from home but cannot do so without the internet. No one at AT&T can give us an update on when this will be fixed.  "Alerts" are a joke. Just says it will be fixed in 24 hours but the 24 hours have come and gone and it still says 24 hours. This is HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE especially for what we pay a month and in the middle of a pandemic. This is an ESSENTIAL SERVICE for those of us working from home. AT &T you are a huge disappointment!!  I'm very close to cancelling and taking my service to Comcast. If not back by tomorrow April 17, I am cancelling my service with AT &T. I will have to wait a week for Comcast to install (already checked) but I will absolutely do it out if spite and principle!!!!!

Calls get you to AUTOMATED HELL only.  No assistance is given.  Patronizing phone center person answers and then sends you to limbo musak for 40 minutes and then drops your call.  All the time you are on the line, there is either dead silence or awful music or worse stupid commercial message that tells you to go to att.com, WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOUR INTERNET IS DOWN.  I called 4 times on Wednesday, April 15th (40+ minutes EACH TIME) and got the same runaround ALL FOUR TIMES.  The fourth time, I actually got a person to answer after being on hold 43 minutes.  Mario in a phone center on the border of Mexico told me that my internet would be back up the next morning at 9:48 a.m., BUT OF COURSE IT WASN'T.  I am supposed to be working from home during COVID.  BUT I CAN'T. So I am back in the office where I'm not supposed to be.  My husband called Thursday, April 16th also to automated hell and got an automated answer that internet would be back up on Friday, April 17th at 10:00 a.m.   The service for AT&T SUCKS.  They should AT LEAST tell the customer the TRUTH about what's going on and why it is happening and let them know how long it will TRULY take to get things up again.  Not knowing anything and waiting is the hardest part. INFORMATION IS HELPFUL EVEN IF IT ISN"T GOOD NEWS.  PLEASE DO A BETTER JOB AND ACTUALLY GIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

4888160437	2020-04-24T15:05:30	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Our internet has been out in 38134 since 11:30 am 4/23/20. The only way I know this is an outage is because I have the Smart Home Manager app. I also downloaded the myAT&T app and was able to chat with a human by clicking "Support," then scrolling to the bottom to click "Call us or chat with us online," then when it said "It's taking longer than normal to reach us...," clicking "My Internet," scrolling until I saw "Prefer to chat?" Once the "Chat" button appeared, I clicked on it and wrote "Human specialist" and was able to get in contact with a person eventually. They told me it would be 18 hours from 8 am 4/24/20, which means 4 am 4/25/20. They said they had to get permission from authorities to have a team of 4 work together on the repair due to the pandemic. Don't know the accuracy of all of that, but it was helpful to at least have some information. I didn't find out if it was weather related or not, but my assumption is that it's lightning or power line down because it happened during the rain yesterday.

4901284246	2020-05-04T21:31:42	thomas_willoughby	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Jacksboro, TN. AT&T is the worst service I have ever dealt with for the past five years. Plain old telephone system used to be great. Had nothing but issues and problems with DSL service and U-verse since. Every time they want to send out a technician when there is an issue and they always say there is never a problem or an outage. Finally have told them to quit sending technicians as there is no problem in the house. System always works when a technician is scheduled to come out. Just have not taken the time to switch to Comcast. Lately I just have to wait until the system decides to come back online. Still their service totally sucks.

For last few weeks my landline phone service keeps getting worse.  Voice keeps breaking up to and from others.  AT&T said they will send me a new WiFi Tower for free to fix problem.  A fee minutes later AT&T emailed a notice the free WiFi caused my monthly service to go up $10.  I also live near the new electric high tower power lines just installed thru Reche Canyon.  I can only hope the $10 monthly increase is worth the FREE WiFi tower that equals an extra $120 per year.  This feels like a poke in the eye after you end a call with broken promises.  Also if I don't return the old Tower I will get charged $99.  I get all this great bundled service for $300 monthly with no cell phone service.

Absolutely insane that a company refuses to be transparent, admit fault, or reach out when problems like this occur. The majority of people in this neighborhood are working from home due to covid or are students trying to complete summer classes and exams. Many have been forced to go to public areas in the heat of a pandemic just to accomplish work. This is completely unforgivable and everyone on my street (8 of us) have already called Spectrum to change internet services. Disappointing to see a company with such lack of concern for their customers - this stunt shows their true colors.

Browser used to just say site not found, looks like somewhere between asking for a site and getting a response AT&T is injecting/redirecting content.  Kinda concerning that they read responses of what people were visiting and then suggest sites, product you may have meant.  Little too low level watching of what users are looking for imo.

They scheduled a technician to come out between 1-5pm on 8/24, to then have At&t send me a vague text cancelling my technician appoint at 2:30. No reason why. I called to find out they canceled because it turned into a network outage with many people in my area impacted with estimated repair by 8/25. Well, just found out it won't be repaired today. It's delayed to 8/28. That'll be 7 days no internet (WiFi). I can't work without WiFi or use my smart TV or many things in my home without access. With Covid, many people are forced to work from home, like myself. We NEED  internet service to work ok our laptop. This is so unacceptable!!! At&t is suppose to address these outage as high priority. Unreal the inconvenience they are putting on people and the lack of proper communication on repair time.

What actually happened? I'm ready to switch service after 10+ years of loyalty. There are just far better service options with much higher mbps than we are currently receiving. And to not at least provide your customers with updates about the status is terrible. So many of us  were left hanging on Labor Day and the day before when many of us work and homeschool from home. I had checked with Spectrum which uses the Verizon towers and they were all cleared for uninterrupted service over the weekend. It's definitely an AT&T issue. Verizon and Spectrum were good to go. Why not AT&T?

Lying Ito the customers inventing excuses with the cables, inventing excuses that we can't see to see if is true or NOt. Internet, TV and Phone outages, are happening every day now and last 48 hours or more. This company is ridiculous and provides the worst service in the word. No wonder is the third company providing slow internet speed, horrible TV services and phones that doesn't work. Customers are loosing money with work lost in the computer, because of the lack of internet. Business phone calls, are busted and TV poor people who wants to relax watching a good movie. Then you call to complain and customer agents drive you more frustrating than ever. Agents tell you that they will help you for good and they are just big liars. This entire company are liars. I'm changing this company tomorrow for a better one. People don't be afraid just change for another company who treat customers better do what I'm going to do we don't have any contract with this crappy ATT.

Have "bundle" with AT&T that I pay for, but spotty or no service - I have to rely on hotspot for wifi, which is the only way I get internet. I've rebooted my hotspot 12-14 times today and FINALLY was able to get on, but this is ridiculous.  I am located in Ocala, FL, near Williston (but still in Marion County).  I have tried contacting customer service, and those idiots tell me to go on the internet and report my problem.  How in the world do you do that when you CAN'T GET ON THE INTERNET ON YOUR COMPUUTER OR YOUR PHONE????? Your customer service STINKS.  I was on the phone three hours yesterday and got passed around to so many people I lost count, and NONE OF THEM COULD HELP.  Nobody knows what they're doing and none of them speak english well enough to be able to understand, so you simply take a "trip around the world", waiting for each one to pass you on to the next idiot.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE???  i am a Real Estate Broker working from home, and I am losing time and money daily due to your HORRIBLE TECHNICAL SERVICE and DESPICABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Current problems and outages	My wife and I live in Eastman, Ga. 60 miles South of Macon, We use the AT&T Country Internet service through a local vendor. I assume he in turn gets the service through a vendor out of Atlanta, it's 4G LTE wireless Internet that comes through a small wireless Router that uses an AT&T SIM card. Our Internet went out some time after 4 Am on Monday nite, Tuesday morning and hasn't been back since, however yesterday the two indicator lights ..Being the Network and Signal lights were just yellow, but all day Thursday thet had turned Red which is kinda weird because the AT&T towers around us are working from what I can tell and we even use CRICKET wireless as our Cell provider which is Provided by AT&T. It's as if the SIM card is no longer active and isn't allowing the Router to access the network. We had an issue once when the Internet just stopped and come to find out the Local guy we pay for internet had changed vendors and we weren't notified in any way until I called and was told we needed to come pick up a new SIM card. For $85.00 a month I would have thought we would be on a group email in order to get notifications of such an issue. That Invoice for the monthly $85.00 seems to show up on time...every month!! It is for what is called Unlimited Internet but the best we get is maybe 12Mbps and that's around 4am..peak hours it never gets better than 1.75Mbps and it is THROTTLED TO DEATH it seems to me because of the way the Speed is constantly up and down...mostly down though!! Is there any way to check and see where our service is actually coming from and if its through a 2nd,or 3rd party vendor? I dont mean to sound like im bitching..but..yes im bitching!! It's all HURRY UP AND WAIT with this BS!!

I have called numerous times today without resolution. The whole neighborhood doesn‚Äôt have internet or phone service service but AT&T doesn‚Äôt show an outage. I informed several representatives that there is ongoing construction in the area and the same thing happened 4-5 months ago. We were told there wasn‚Äôt an outage but 2 days later AT&T communicated there was an outage and that they are working to resolve it. If customer service is the focus, AT&T is missing the mark. The level of effort required to resolve an issue is unacceptable. So until AT&T decides there is an outage we are left without internet or phone service. Frustrated in Arlington!!!!

5078597312	2020-09-20T21:57:17	unavailable	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	My elderly parents in their 80's have been out of home telephone service since last Wednesday, 9-16-20 at approximately 6:30 A.M.  Today is Sunday, 9-20 at 5:45 P.M. Neighborhood telephone service below Belle Chasse, LA, was restored within 24 hours in my parents neighborhood, yet, my elderly parents are still without phone service.  Their grandson went to their home to trouble shoot and make sure it was not an issue with the phone inside the house.  It is on the telephone company's side. He has called, but nothing has happened and the issue is still unresolved.    My elderly mother flagged down an AT&T worker in the neighborhoogd today and explained the issue to him and asked why everyone else had phone service and she still did not.  His reply to her was "Your guess is as good as mine, but I'll pass on the information."  How helpful and caring of him!  The road on the extra mile is never crowded!  I am their daughter and have also attempted to call today, but AT&T is not available on Sundays.  I plan to call tomorrow at 7 A.M. when AT&T opens.    There was no issue due to hurricane Sally.  This outage was due to a driver hitting a pole.  This issue should not have taken this long to resolve, considering everyone in the neighborhood has had telephone service restored.

Current problems and outages	SEPT. 29, 2020 UPDATE: PEMBROKE PINES, FL. 33027  Today is SEPT. 29, 2020 Since SEPT. 15th, I Still DO NOT HAVE AT&T Landline Service for my Home Telephone. üò° SEPT. 25th (last Friday) was the 5TH TIME that I called up AT&T Repair Service Dept. (REPAIR TICKET # NSOWSM29). Person I spoke with said "AT&T TECHNICIANS ARE STILL WORKING ON FIXING AT&T'S OUTSIDE CABLES. SERVICE SHOULD BE RESTORED BY SEPT. 28TH MONDAY" (YESTERDAY).   This IS UNACCEPTABLE! üò° Maybe the "FCC." Should Look into & Investigate AT&T's Incompetent Handling of Its WIDESPREAD OUTAGE PROBLEMS with It's Home Telephones/Cellphones/Internet/TV. & U-Verse Services!  -----------------------------------------  I am a Senior Citizen & I live in Pembroke Pines, FL. 33027. Today is Sept. 26th. Since Sept. 15th my AT&T Landline Service for my home Telephone Has NOT been working!. üôÄüò° I have already called up AT&T Repair Service Dept. 5 times & spoken with several persons there (after being "bounced around to other AT&T Depts."). (AT&T Repair Ticket # NSOW5M29). My last phone call to AT&T Repair Dept. was yesterday Sept. 25th. Every time I called they told me the Same Response "AT&T Technicians are still working on fixing the Outside Cables & Service 'should be' Restored by Sept. 28th (Mon.)." Each day, AT&T has "moved up their Service Restoration Date & Timeline". It SHOULD NOT Take this long for AT&T Technicians to Fix this problem & Restore my Service! üò° I have been using my AT&T Cellphone to make & receive calls (with a lot of "Dropped Calls."). Since 1992, I have been a long time & "loyal" AT&T Customer (with my & my Father's Landline Home Telephone Service, 6 AT&T Cellphones between my father & myself & Internet Service). AT&T has Terrible Repair Service & It's Customer Service Dept. personnel Stink! After all of these years having AT&T Service for my Home Telephone, my Cellphones & Internet Service, I feel like switching to AT&T's Competitor XFINITY/COMCAST. Overall, They will offer me Better Overall Service for a Better Price.

At first I thought maybe it's cause I'm in the woods now but its not even woods like that. And honestly man it's not just me, after reading the comments here, i am sure of one thing, AT&T y'all seen the last of me. This was acting up before I got out here, i was in vegas, but it wasn't nearly as bad. For almost 3 years I've been using this service and it's been fine. All of a sudden like a few weeks ago I noticed it slowing down. Constantly stuck loading the page or video, yet for the ads, it loads and plays no problem. Without a hitch.  Y'all got your priorities wrong.   Within the past week the problem has skyrocket. I can't even load a song on YouTube, yet, you guessed it, it loads and plays the at before buffering on each and every video.  Thanks for charging me 15 bucks more than you were supposed to last month as well. Like I was going to just not even mention that but, again your advertisers should be the ones on the hook. Not the common cat just tryna play some music or google some shit, or even know if someone's trying to call. Cause that's another thing, not that im the most popular cat, but there is a reason beyond internet i pay for this shit in the first place and it's to stay in touch with my people's.   Peace.

Their service has always been substandard with constant outages on both phone systems.

Current problems and outages	Paying $75 a month for less speed than I got for $25 from Frontier (10Mbps vs 12 Mbps), and only getting 1/10 of what I'm paying for (currently maxing out at 1.4 Mbps).  This keeps happening,  and AT&T can't explain it.  But they know they are the only internet that comes out where I live now, so they get away with this crap.

Current problems and outages	I have had little to no service for the last 3 1/2 weeks and have called over ten times to ask when At&t is going to fix the problem and get the same answer that they are working on it and it will take about two to three weeks to be fixed.  I think that AT&T is full of B.S. that they are working on the 5G part of the their new system and are forgetting everything else! We are less important to them.

Current problems and outages	Northwest Arkansas: For over a week, some calls not going thru, and when you leave a voicemail, the recipient may not see it in their inbox for a day, or a week. Other ATT users have said same is happening to them. It‚Äôs probably Google, Fakebook, and Twitter trying to control the conversations we have, at least until Trump concedes. LOL!

5156165986	2020-11-18T12:23:14	disqus_6w8KPEIaMJ	istheservicedown	AT&T outage or service down? Current problems and outages	TV, Internet and phones went out at 11:30am Monday morning (11/16/2020) and are still out.   Every call made to ATT indicates they are aware of problem and track status at att.com/outages; however, that website says that the estimated time of repair is 11/15/2020 at 9:30pm.   Since the problem we experienced didn't even take place until 11/16/2020, this is VERY frustrating.   At least some kind of estimate on the "att.com/outages" site would be helpful!   This is DEVASTATING to those who have to work from home and now cannot do so with no Internet service.   An estimate would help ease that frustration!   This is from Fraser, Michigan.....
