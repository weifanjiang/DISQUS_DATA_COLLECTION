4264053457	2018-12-31T21:41:24	cassandraofee	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	All circuits busy? Over 15 mins, Shiloh, IL. I do need it to actually BE A PHONE, first and foremost. #Seriously guys? I'm a customer of 18+years of Verizon & one of the best reasons was availability & coverage map.   This has been happening more frequently to me, especially here in Shiloh & O'Fallon, IL. Maybe they need another tower in the area, as it's growing so fast?  #Wishing Verizon would actually read this.... 😂  Cassandra.ofee@gmail.com

4272542544	2019-01-06T20:08:22	ldsw	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Is there a total outage with Verizon Fios in Bryans Road MD...again? This service is definitely not all that promising given multiple outages within the last three to four months. Unfortunately having phone internet and TV in the hands of one company is a bridge too far. Strongly despise spouse's decision to go this route. If I ever get the upper hand on this setup I will definitely diversify the carriers for each of these services. DirectTV was way more stable than this overpriced Verizon Fios setup that ballooned to more $300. I will start telling and warning  everyone who's willing to here our experience with Verizon Fios to consider keeping services separated to avoid becoming captive and a hostage to a single provider. Good riddance if I get a chance to disrupt this foolishness.

Neither my internet or cell phone are working. I live way out of town and rely on Verizon Wireless for (essentially all) my communication with the "outside" world. I'm near Black Diamond, Washington.

Yesterday, after waiting 2 days, a service rep came out and found that a previous service rep who worked on a neighbors house had incorrectly put jumpers on the main terminal, knocking out my internet service.  Now tonight, after coming home from work, I find I have no TV service for any of the STBs in my house.  Been waiting for over 25 mins to speak with a service rep.

Current problems and outages	My neighbors and I in Dover, Delaware have had no Verizon DSL service now for a month.  (Fios is still  not available in our community).  Every time we call we get a different story as to what the problem is.  I have demanded and received a credit for the month of service, but we are still left out in limbo as to when, if at all, the problem will be resolved.  In the meantime, I am able to use a neighbor's Comcast WiFi temporarily to connect to the Internet.  If we do not get DSL back within the next week, I will switch to Comcast myself and drop all Verizon services including phone and Internet since everything is "bundled".  I am not wasting any more time contacting Verizon and talking to customer service reps in India whom I can barely understand and who give me nothing but apologies and lip service.

Router reset & working. Devices connect but message says no service. Using data to do this much on my smartphone. This is the 2nd widespread & long lasting fios outage in 2 weeks. Time for Verizon to do something about their equipment if a winter storm in one area can ruin their service across the country (it's snowing here, about 2" & still coming down, no serious wind, NBD in the northern tier of states or even in the Pittsburgh area where I grew up...so do they ever have internet service in winter in places like Vermont, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc.???).  And I think we should get a reduction in the bill when we have putages this long. The last one was 18 hours if memory serves.

When anyone tries to leave a message, it asks them to eneter a Mailbox Number and pass code.  When I go to check my voicemail, I get the same message.  I'm able to reach the messages, but it's usually an instant connection without the mailbox nonsense.  I tried to find a Service number which was an hour project.  I finally got a route to service, by dialing "operator",  with a waiting time of one hour to talk with a representative.  Of course, I was advised to go to Verizon's website by recording, which was another wasted hour in search of an answer.  I did get to an outage map and I'm hoping the problem is caused by the high wind problems we're having (Westwood, NJ).  While I love technology, it sure would be nice to talk with a HUMAN BEING!

Sometimes it happens every twenty minutes other times it's great for several hours?  It's not the phone because I've been fighting this for almost two weeks and even had the phone replaced by Verizon. Very frustrating that the signal keeps dropping randomly where I've always had a strong LTE signal. All of this has happened at my home and other places obviously as well. I'm just stating that I've always had a very good LTE signal at home only for it to magically be hit and miss. Verizon even figured it was my phone because after troubleshooting with them and getting a new SIM card it still does it? Nothing has changed demographically or with the house...... I'm at a loss???

4368704898	2019-03-07T21:02:04	unavailable	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I recently spent nearly a grand on phones. One of those was because the in store rep fucked up my grandmother's phone while attempting (and failing) to make updates to her phone. (It worked fine walking in the store.) I have unlimited and have always used the phones wifi for everything. My phone replaces internet, phone, cable. I literally depend on it for everything. Ever since I've gotten this phone - my service has been absolute shit. I live in the middle of a fairly large town (where you would expect to have NO problems with internet connection) and can't even use basic streaming sites such as YouTube. What the fuck, Verizon? You have one job to do.

4370021146	2019-03-08T19:26:01	xgempler	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Verizon FIOS has been down over 24 hours in our building and others in 10011 - in the heart of Manhattan, NYC, not some small little rural location. Verizon reports it will not be resolved until 10pm saturday night making this a 100+ hour outage of Internet, TV, and Phone.   Verizon offers no explanation as to why it will take so long to repair and they have wait times of over a half hour to talk to someone to discuss the issue, It appears that they never anticipated the possibility of problems with their service and their communication with customers is non existent and they hold their customers in complete contempt. The good news is that even if you are under contract you can cancel service with them for a minor fee that depends on how many months are left with your contract.   The only advantage to FIOS vs Spectrum *WAS* speed but Spectrum now offers gigabit to those that need it.  FIOS has a total lack of support and their pricing is a scam with low advertised prices that are false as they require you to pay for necessary equipment to use their service, and unlike cable they require contracts making it completely undesirable for renters.  FIOS Sucks!

I could be in the middle of the city in a parking lot and websites dont load. The odd part is that if I use my VPN, I get better service most times. I have friends that have "crap" T-mobile and the new xfinity and have great service. Ive called in and keep getting the run around. They troubleshoot my phone. I always update my phones. New one every year. My bill keeps going up and the service is getting worse. Its super frustrating and nothing is changing.

Originally she contacted verizon because of the service outage. If I did not work 60 miles away from there I would drop everything and visit him!!!

But for the past few months sometimes my internet browser doesn’t load. We’ve had Verizon Fios in my apartment since August and it occasionally is slow and sometimes doesn’t allow our devices to connect.   What’s going on with Verizon?

Keep getting pop up white window saying “Verizon has turned off LTE calls on your account”. (They haven’t.) Techs advised me to turn off, then on LTE Data & Voice, then restart iphone 6s+. That didn’t work. Tech calls keep dropping. I also have a “home phone” (regular plug in) that connects via Verizon cellular. (little box with antenna.)  It’s also out. Both were fine last night.

I got on with Tracfone, and 90 minutes and two departments later, I still have the issue and they seem confused by it.  I got on facebook to let people know to tag the land line if they need me, and a friend let me know that another friend was having the same difficulty with her Verizon service.  One of the techs I talked to also mentioned that Tracfone in this area is partnered to Verizon, so I decided to look here.

Current problems and outages	For the best Verizon service, I pay a premium price - yet, here I sit in the midst of online and phone transactions WITH NO SERVICE. Completely unacceptable - Naples/Bonita Springs FL. My phone goes from 4 bars to ... (whatever that means) - but it’s a crapshoot as to whether the call goes thru or not. I can use my wi-fi as last resort but not for phone calls. And I am ASTOUNDED at how wide spread Verizon issues are: San Diego CA to Naples FL and spots in between. Does not bode well.

Verizon is adding 5g. They don't want to put up more cell phone towers so they take a 4g antenna and replace it with a 5g. So their service is going backwards. And I think there service is now equal or worse than other providers. Prob time to look elsewhere we've complained as a company and Verizon does not care.

It use to be that I would be the only person in the group that would have service. Now when I am in town, where they actually have a tower, my data takes forever to load up. Everyone else's phones have brought up the information while mine is still trying. No outages, they just have too many people on the tower so it all starts slowing down to nothing. They don't care enough about their customers to fix the problem because they are already making more money than every other service provider. I can tell you this though, if you came here to read comments to see if you should switch to Verizon, don't, this service is not any better than anyone else and their coverage map is nonsince and crap. In other words, you will pay a lot more for service that is not any better than anything that you currently have.

Biggest coverage area in the county doesn't mean a thing when it's down! AND.... we expect a detailed explanation of why it went down! Not some canned response like "We regret any inconvenience" bull. When you communicate clearly, honestly, and detailed about why it's down and when service might be restored, people can be much more patient! Thank You!

I do understand the frustration of others when your service doe not work.

It seems like Verizon's having more and more of these down days.  I wish it was explained to us.  Maybe Elon Musk's SpaceX internet beams to replace cell towers that the FCC just approved, will help.  "I can hear you now" God Bless❤

I’d be FIRED if I acted in this way in my daily job. Get your acts together— you are all grown adults & this is an atrocity, the rate of speed both Dominion & Verizon take sweet time— however, have absolutely no problem taking your money!!!!! Funny how that works— public never has any rights. You guys should all be ashamed of yourselves for how you conduct business & treat the public as a whole.

Cannot call out or receive calls. FaceTime works as it is web based and not tied into Verizon. THIS IS POSSIBLY DUE TO MILITARY TRAINING AS EXPERIENCED IN PAST OUTAGES-military use of bandwidth pre-empts public use and is an option of a local military base to use the bandwidth service even in training. Due to the recent comments by John Bolton of an attack on Iran this may be the case. GPS is definitely limited in such cases due to military use at such times.

Current problems and outages	I pay over 400 dollars a month for what is suppose to be the best phone service. I am constantly having service issue with both of my phones and iPad. I’m honestly considering changing to AT&T. Also as a US service member I am away from my family for long periods of time and not being able to contact them is more than frustrating. I am truly disappointed in my Verizon service and experience. It’s just unacceptable for the amount of money I pay to not have a reliable service. All of my devices are on the unlimited plan so there should be no reason for the constant breakage in my service.  Location Durham, NC 27704

Seemed to be resolved late last night and though this morning...until just got cut off mid-call with a family member and now the ‘no service’ indicator showing again. So, the weird thing is my wife, who’s in the same location as me also with Verizon service, does have service.  How in the heck can she have it but I don’t...why does this keep happening? Get your crap together Verizon or I’m moving on to another company. And let’s not just resolve for 12 hours...would like a permanent fix.

GRIDLEY CALIFORNIA  It took 3 calls screwing around  with Verizons virtual chat, 45 min of useless chatting with a computer  before I could even get to the option to have a Tech support rep call me back.. 2 hours later I finally got a call back, i spent almost 3 hours on the phone with a very nice Verizon Tech support lady, but she had NO report of any outages in my area..  So together we trouble shot the hell out of my phone, only to end up having to take the absolute last measure of doing a Factory Rest Needless to say that did not restore the network connection & to top it off even after backing up & restoring my data prior to doing a hard reset I lost all of my recent calls & texts & saved voicemails! Granted, the lady I worked with was nothing less then an angel! But I'm baffled at how the top ranking cellular phone company, Verizon.. a multi million dollar conglomeration is not able to detect cellular outages in a timely manor.. I say this only because in the last 7 months this was the 3rd time I've had Network Connection issues that have ended up being an outage, that Verizon was not aware of when I initially called in!!

Current problems and outages	We live in Troy, Alabama and have been experiencing cell service with my cell phone for the last 3 weeks.  I have always had service at my home and everywhere in Troy, Alabama but now people can't hear me when they call me vice verse the same as when I make calls.  Also calls are constantly dropped when I am fortunate to have service.  I have complained to the local Verizon store who claim everyone is experiencing the same problem State wide.  My husband has Verizon service and hasn't experienced any problems in Montgomery, Alabama where he lives and works on weekdays.  My mother has heart problems and unless this  interruption in service is corrected immediately, I will discontinue my service with Verizon after being a loyal customer for over 25 years.

4555516571	2019-07-27T13:03:19	disqus_GjQEbrmYp4	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I hate Verizon. I have about 1/2 a bar most often (seriously).  On my Note 8, for the past 6-7 months, my CONTACTS fail to back up 95% of the time! And of course,  they have NO CLUE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. This has been happening almost every day since upgrade to Pie. Hubby's phone (S8) was purchased 2 yrs ago, would *not* back up even ONE contact when he first purchased the phone!. I had to work with Tier 2 for about 6 MONTHS to get contacts backed up on the cloud .... of course they charge $10/mo. for the phones, whether or not the backup fails.  Verizon is following the "AT&T motto: CHARGE  FEES  FOR  EVERYTHING" - until you cancel the service because it doesn't work! VZW is now charging '$10 for this', '$5 for that', '$3 for something else'. Ultimately this company creates such an exorbitant bill, which MIGHT be acceptable  ... if the phones WORKED properly.  THIS IS ABSURD. [Greenwood, IN]

Current problems and outages	I responded to you on another site, but I forget which :)  Thank you for the updates!  4pm Sunday, still nada.  My problem is I actually have Total Wireless, which uses Verizon towers here.  I'm not a big phone person, just occasional calls/texts-which were kinda important to use this past day.    If I attempt to call TW, I'll end up routed to India and get disconnected no less than 3 times, sit on hold forever, only to be told oh I do ticket, here #, be fixed tomorrow lol.  Fortunately I've only had to call them for a problem once before.  I've tried calling Verizon before, actually to ask about their plans, but was too much of a pain for a non customer to get thru their lines.  Luckily my home internet/wifi is thru ATT and there's no problems with that...knock on wood.

4587906938	2019-08-22T16:59:22	patrickvanner	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Having worked in a mid-sized telecom company, the number of outages and duration are beyond stupid. As a senior network designer, if we had even a quarter of what has been going on, just in northern VA, the whole team would be walking out the door as soon as someone they brought in fixed it.  Right now, I would like to know if Verizon is at least going credit us the data usage on our devices during these outages, as (For those of us that still have cell phone access), because the ONLY WAY TO ACTUALLY REPORT AN OUTAGE IS BY USING MY DATA PLAN!!  They should also be crediting accounts for the loss of access to some or most of their services.   Outages happen. It is a fact of life in the telecom industry, but this many at outages in my zip code range alone, tells me that Verizon has a serious network design flaw. The only exception would be if it was a physical issue like the switch/router, pop, co-lo, or upstream/downstream providers.  If that is the case, the fact that they cannot repair and/or reroute within a couple of hours, tops, is again a flaw in their fail over plan.  Bottom line, a mistake is to be forgiven, an error is making the same mistake again, and should be corrected.  Verizon, this is beyond a mistake within less than a month.  Get a REAL trouble shooting team in there, give them the full authority to get things fixed, leave them a corporate card to get what is need to fix these ongoing issues, and walk out the door.  Your network will be up and running in about two hours , slowly and with intermittent errors, and will be totally fixed in a day or two, depending on equipment requirements and delivery times.  All the install requirements can be handled after the fact. Figure it out before your thousands and thousands of customers listen to your former spokesperson and go with someone else because, "alll networks are pretty much the same".

Normally, I have 1 to 2 bars of service and the cell tower is just 2 miles down the road (straight, I can see it from my driveway).  This service degradation has been occuring with more frequency the last month and with complete losses during the last week.  Sometimes it is no service, sometimes roaming with 1X or roaming with LTE, and sometimes it is ok  Our only phone and internet service is via Verizon, there are no other options.  This is a farm business and we absolutely need the service.  I called in a trouple ticket (NRB000009952513) yesterday, but service has gotten worse since then.  What is going on.  This is unlike the service we've experienced over the last several years.  Verizon has been stable and consistent.  Now, it is unreliable.  I am in the 99705 area.

Current problems and outages	Repost from last night Outside of Patterson, ca (DG) WHY the F doesn't Verizon have down alerts on their towers? I work for an MSP. and as a general rule-- we get an alert before our customers even know.  Oh my Verizon need to train their people to pay more attention.  No Service NO SIGNAL since @1 pm today. (as I type it after 7pm PST) I opened 2 different chat sessions, and explained that Wireless service was unavailable in my area, NOT just myself. my fiance and neighbors (bear in mind I'm an it tech) but they STILL claimed that there is not a service outage and asked me to do what i had already explained: that i had already done.(powercycle the phone, remove and re-insert the SIM. ETC And even though I explained that this is my only phone service, they asked me to call 888-294-6804.???  Luckily i'm crafty and persistent, I rigged up my amazon Alexa to make calls from my phone (neat!) and called.... that was @5:45 pm it's now almost 8---- and I am the one making the outage report.  I was told it would be fixed "in the next 24 hours" WHAAAAAAAT???  I'm still on hold with a supervisor making the full report. We'll see what answer i get  Color me FURIOUS this level of ignorance will drive savvy customers away!  Now 8pm and after a 1/2 hour of hold time, I FINALLY got an NBR ticket # 000009967585. thank you to the rep i spoke with, she was doing the best she can.  Verizon?

Current problems and outages	It has been at least 34 hours (perhaps more) in a major metropolitan area (Austin, Round Rock Georgetown TX) WITHOUT cellular service/texting. Why is there no information on the internet OR ON THE VERIZON SITE acknowledging the problems and giving updates on resummption of service?? There is NO available information on the verizon site regarding, acknowledgeing or commenting on "down service" . There is a phoney drop down menu offering a "ticket" to document a users personal outage data and subsequently be reimbursed - however, the drop down menu leads to a dead end. My goodness,  what a shady and devious way for Verizon to cut their losses and obligations - simply "hide" from any responsibility . Classic

I switched over from AT&T two years ago and it was so good up until these past few months.. I keep getting no signal just out of the blue, and sadly, I use my phone for EVERYTHING. GPS, internet, call, texting, entertainment... So this is a problem - if we didn't want signal/service, we wouldn't pay our bill. As a matter of fact we do very much prefer to have our service ON which is why we promptly pay our bills to you. This is so frustrating because it's happened to us two times in two months, without any warnings whatsoever. It wouldn't be so irritating if the outage is only for a few minutes or an hour, but Verizon's take a WHOLE day. Why??

Verizon Support claims no outages, but local news stations describe interference with a new carrier south of the border. This situation is more than inconvenient.

4657046387	2019-10-18T14:11:57	unavailable	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	This is the craziest outage I have ever witnessed!  About 9:30 or 10:00 last night every service around us went out!  I'm on the outskirts of Sylva and BOTH of the two internet lines went out about 15 mins apart.  Happens sometimes right.  Well then we noticed my cell phone had ABSOLUTELY NO service or Data at all.... NEVER have I seen this, usually even in 0 service areas it will have a blip of a bar but not actually work. So I ask the household and all 5 of the cellphones are the same.  It only got weirder from there!  With no internet connection and no cell service what so ever and all different model cell phones on 2 different carriers.........our times and dates changed WAY back!  I suddenly had March 2nd of 2000 and an hour plus behind time.  All the other cells were changed to but all different dates and times. I started looking into the settings thinking maybe the emergency location worked only to find a SECOND "guest" profile logged into my (locked) phone!!!!   WTF?!?!?  How?  The internet came back on at around 4am I think. A while after that my phone went in and out of service then finally back to normal.  But the secondary "guest" account.....gone.   also, I may not be the smartest or know alot about it but how is it that both the internet (cable run ) and the cell (satellite ) service randomly went down at the same time?      Side note-- husband works in Cherokee and landlines were out there too.  Also-- our internet goes in and out with both lines and on occasion will change the time on 1 of the phones. Always the same though....this was all different times and dates 5 phones.

4660921691	2019-10-21T23:30:32	unavailable	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	WiFi has been out for almost 5 hours. Spent well over an hour on chat with some expert bc we couldn’t get anyone in the phone. This expert tech had me running from the modem to a box on a different wall to a box outside multiple times each time to press a button or unplug until I was told to go outside my home. Where after figuring out how to open the box he had no instruction on what I should do. There was no button to push just multiple wires so it was a guessing game. Again on direct chat with the expert. But no clue on what wire to pull just try it. Guess what?!? Didn’t work. Now they have given up and say someone has to come to my house and I have to be inconvenienced and stay home from work so they can get it but here is the kicker they can’t come for two entire days! Like many others everything I have is based on WiFi so I’m basically screwed until they get someone at my house that knows what to do.

We used to have good service but a few months ago, after seeing folks working on the tower, our service went from several bars and Verizon 3G down to nothing but 1 bar roaming.  I  pay the same as everyone else and should get the service I was promised when we first started up.

Current problems and outages	Sheriff's dispatcher, last night, said she heard "on the news" that VERIZON MOBILE is not working in our area. It took calling 911 and immediately saying this is NOT an emergency-- please transfer me to a non-emergency dispatcher-- to finally get through after hours of trying. And we're in a hazardous fire area with limited access in and out of our community by road. A County emergency radio technician suggested complaining to the PUC and the Office of Emergency Service, since VERIZON essentially has a monopoly in our area since they WERE the only service that worked.

4676074390	2019-11-03T15:50:07	disqus_TMIvdfVz2U	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I have a Galaxy J3 PHONE, and no phone or voicemail. I have been to the Verizon store 4 times, put on hold forever with tech support 4 times, did a complete reset, and NO phone service, not even on WI-FI. I can't use my phone as a phone. No 3G at the top of my screen, no bars in the little triangle box. They, at the store, keep telling me to just buy a new much more expensive phone? Verizon has robbed us enough, and now they want more and more money. I am 74 years old, retired, Viet-Nam vet who just would like my darn phone to at least pretend to be a phone. This is totally unacceptable. We have been customers for years and years.

4676680189	2019-11-04T03:11:07	disqus_zBzIta	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Verizon support was futile for the most part. one tech support person told me, and this was after two days dealing with them,  they were updating their service to 5G and older phones(mine isn't that old) would need a new sim card update for new id or new  phone. they mentioned they had no outage reports in my city. odd, i drove to a Verizon store and there were quite a few ppl in there getting newer phones because of this. after about and hour counter help called on me, told me my phone was too old and would need a new one. around 185usd extra a year and that phone was on the cheaper side! i told them i only wanted a sim card update, no new phone. tells me they don't have the older sim card in stock but they could get it in a few days. i'm getting a  bit crankier by this time as two days now with no working phone (could recv text). found another Verizon store in town and they did have a sim card that fit and presto, phone worked. that sales rep told me about the 5G updates too and that probably early next year my phone won't work at all and will *have* to get a newer phone. freakin tech support online could have simply told me that and give an addr to a nearby store that had the correct sim card. they are probably told not to in order to force ppl to upgrade.  it isn't what it's supposed to be, that runaround was non funny joke!!

Current problems and outages	vegas area.& vent time.  went through all the tech support levels up to tier 2 networking. said they would get back to me in 24-48 hours. they texted the phone finally day or two later that they completed their ticket and sent a link to a verizon page that basically said nothing wrong with their network therefore it must be my phone and to try all these problem solving items listed, you know, all the same ones i'd been doing with first level support for almost a week!  this is after they said get a new sim card which i did, which the phone then worked for a couple of days. then again no calls in/out but could get text. one tech support person read back the error message that was in the support ticket, {me, my phone} was not authorized to access their network.  really, well then authorize it!!  i left the house on an errand and all of a sudden the phone worked today. in that case thought maybe a cell tower glitch. nope, phone still working at home so not a tower issue.   ironic, the errand was to get a new phone and provider which i did as i can't rely on verizon anymore. a whole week of this, really? this time verizon support said they would send me a new phone at no charge. last week they wanted to sell me a newer phone. i don't recall what brand/model phone was free, but i declined it for now.  looks like many of us on these "service down" websites have similar issues all across the CONUS. i will say, probably wise to have two+ phones from diff providers anyways just in case issues like this crop up. good luck to all of us with this verizon issue(s), ya think!

Main base of phone kept reporting "Home line engaged" even though I was not on the line, and when I tried to hang up and disengage the line, it would not let me do that. Now there is no connection coming through the phone jack at all. I even tried my old princess phone that I keep for emergency use because it doesn't rely on electricity to function and that does not currently have a dial tone either when plugged into the phone jack - the line is dead. I called Verizon tech through my Frontier carrier, and they were unaware of the widespread nature of this problem at the time, but they could not figure out what was wrong although they tried a bunch of things -they are sending someone on Saturday to see what's happening. But now that I know this is a very widespread problem, I hope Verizon figures this out before then.. .

The Cell service is still not working, The tech told me there are no reported outages in our area. Well I have numerous phones on our accounts that are not working.

Seriously Verizon? If I don't pay my bill you'd be too happy to cut me off in a minutes notice but its ok to have my business on halt because of your mishaps? They need to be held accountable for this BS! Luckily I was able to get internet service here at the place I am staying but it still doesn't help with important phone calls that missed or I couldn't make today. I truly hope this is fixed like yesterday because if this halts my business anymore I'll be more livid!

The snowstorm knocked out our power for about 12 hours on 11/29/19, but it has since been restored. However, our Verizon phones are still not working.  It doesn't help that Verizon suggests we call for support using a landline, since we DON'T have one.  We tried rebooting phones to no avail.  Our zip code is 86305.  Anybody out there with a land line that can please report this to Verizon?  My guess is the when power was restored it flipped some switch in a cell tower that has not yet been reset.

4719409956	2019-12-10T16:46:02	laura_hogue	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Reno, Nevada- I haven’t been able to make a call from my home for two days until I set up the WiFi assist on my phone. They had me rest my phone 3 times, they resynched it twice, sent me to the Verizon store and switched out my sims card. The associate there turned on the WiFi assist. When WiFi assist is turned off, the new sims card did nothing. With WiFi assist on, I can call out and people hear me fine, no breaking up. When in a different part of town I have no issue. I have lived here for 2 yrs in this home and sit in front of a picture window. Verizon is saying they have never guaranteed service inside a bldg. ‘can you hear me now’ isn’t funny anymore. No, Verizon. No. No one can hear me. I was also routed after 8 hrs on th and off the phone and chat with them from various locations, to a tier 2 associate for a booster/extender. After 1 hr and 48 minute wait I am told a booster/extender plugs into the router and uses the WiFi EXACTLY LIKE WIFI ASSIST THEY HAVE ME USING. In other words 2 hr wait for nothing. If this doesn’t change I will have to get a corded landline phone to assure I have phone service if the power goes out because without power I won’t have WiFi to be able to assist. If I have to get a landline again from ATT you can bet I will do the pkg deal for cell with ATT and dump Verizon. I hate to do that though because I would lose my old phone number which is an area exclusive Verizon number. Sigh. This is a shit show.

Like a fool I enabled this. Have no internet. Disabling does nothing, still no internet. You need to find a way to pull back this feature that was pushed out. Your customer service staff do not have knowledge or ability to correct the problem (spending hours performing tasks on the canned response to a caller w/ no internet is a waste of everybody’s time).

I attempted to contact Verizon service using the chat function on their Web site because I've had no phone service for hours. The stupid machine was able to connect me to sales, but not to support. I was told to call support using a landline. If I had a landline, I wouldn't need this expensive, unreliable cellular crap, would I? It is so typical that I can reach sales but not support. Corporations aren't interested in existing customers who have paid them thousands of dollars over the years. They're only interested in new customers who can increase their reported quarterly earnings. Greed is a deadly sin, and if God is just, all of these corporate clowns will burn in hell.

I remembered to completely shutoff/power on my phone (aka power cycle) my phone. This forces the phone to re-register on the VzW network which restored service to my phone. VzW most likely had a network issue today ( MME or HSS for you wireless network geeks) to disrupt service until the phone re-registered which clears the issue. I was a Bell Labs telcom engineer that built VzW core networks ( MME/SRS/SGW/ eNobeBs) in the Northeast & Southwest so that how I know.

We have always been in a dead zone although we only live about 2 miles from the old Cell Tower on Armory Drive. So now Verizon has installed a new Cell Tower across the street from my house on Fairview Drive. The antenna is up, lights are blinking on the top of the tower, it has used over 1000Kw of electricity and I still have no service/not bars on my cell phone. Not just my cell phone but anyone that stops by house my has not service, my neighbors have no service either. My cell does not always ring and the calls go straight to voice mail. I still get dropped calls on almost every call that does come though. I have been a Verizon Customer for 20 plus years. Service is only getting worse.

4765162396	2020-01-21T13:47:28	unavailable	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Completely irate. Phone, data and text is completely down with Verizon Wireless. Been on the phone with tech support (land line). He could not even figure out what was going on. He then stated there was an outage in my area and that service would be restored in 12 hours. He's joking, right? I then looked and there have been reports that service has been out for the past 10 hours. Verizon, is there no plan "B"? Do you not have a backup plan with other service providers to switch networks for a period if something like this occurs? I pay over $200 on my cell phone bill. I am at work at a place where I am limited from using landlines and cannot receive emails. I rely on my phone. I truly feel bad that have an emergency that need to dial 911. Many have given up their landlines for cell phones. I now was just hung up by Verizon when asked to speak to a supervisor. Stellar service! Changing providers.

4779882577	2020-02-01T20:47:44	disqus_H6Nj34b7Ry	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Crappy 4g for over a week and a half all over Beloit Wisconsin.  I opened a ticket but of course it's all good to Verizon.  Also according to Verizon no new tickets are out since 12/19/2019. So all my 5 phone's with two different operating systems are not Verizons fault. The person I just talked to from Verizon refused to open another ticket. This is the type of service I get for 500 dollars a month. Also I'm dropping phone calls and having distorted  phone calls. I have to drive out of my way to a corporate store because a Verizon phone tech refuses to put another ticket in. The first Verizon phone tech was wonderful and put in excellent notes and encouraged me to put in another ticket if I'm not getting the service I pay for. I had good service prior to this so that's why it's such a big thing to me. If they are fixing a tower or updating it that's fine I just want to know this won't be permanent.

4791540342	2020-02-11T05:11:34	unavailable	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	This is BS. As of 8pm I cannot call or text anyone! Not even verizon. I am medically compromised. I can't even call 911 if I have an emergency. This is gross negligence on behalf of verizon. If anyone has a medical issue or any other kind needing assistance Verizon is at fault. Get our phones working! Text and email and all the other sorts don't really matter but the fact that we cannot even call 911 is alarming and irresponsible. I chatted with customer service on verizon.com to problem solve and they sent me to a third party site asking for me to put my credit card information and asked for $1 to get answers from tech support! That's ludicrous.   take responsibility and get this resolved verizon. I've been a customer for 20+ years but none of that ever seems to matter. Do lives matter? Does it matter that I have a terminal illness and might need to call 911 at any time? Or is all that matters the bottom line.

We will work with and prioritize network demand in assisting many U.S.  hospitals, first responders and government agencies, as needed."   https://www.verizon.com/about/news/update-verizon-serve-customers-covid-19   So, in other words, Verizon is "robbing Peter to pay Paul". Hence, tough luck if your wireless service has been rerouted. Bye Bye Verizon

This is day 3 in Southfield, Michigan.   Verizon is "prioritizing network demand", according to their website- https://www.verizon.com/about/news/update-verizon-serve-customers-covid-19   However, the reality is that NOTHING stands in the way of IoT or Internet of Things.   Afterall, is it not more important for your refrigerator to report what you are eating, or ordering a  Frappuccino at a drive-through, compared to having 911 service available from a non-working cell phone? So THIS is what we can all expect from the telecommunications industry when the going gets tough- Ultimately, we are on our own.

My phone is bouncing from 4G with one bar, to 3G with one bar, to 1X, and to simply “NO SERVICE”, all the time, throughout the day and night. I’m sure the network is flooded with so many people at home during this virus outbreak, but this has been an issue for quite some time. Simply not enough towers here to handle the traffic in normal circumstances. There is virtually no broadband service available in this city, and many rely on their phones here. Even all of the stores here have DSL at best and their systems are extremely slow all of the time.

4908800492	2020-05-10T21:17:24	unavailable	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Akron OH area. This is exhausting. I can get some incoming calls (if it doesn't automatically kick to voice mail) but any voice calls disconnect after a few seconds. Outgoing calls are hit and miss - mostly miss, but also get disconnected. And even while connected calls get static and fade in and out. This has been going on for over a week. One day, was able to suffer through the horrible voice connection with 3 reps only to be told by last rep I talked to that they just got news from Corporate about technical support issues. Next day seemed ok. Then, more of same issue in following days.Thought it was fixed via live chat the other day but nope.  Never had probs calling from home before all this. Bars jump from 3-4 strong and then jump to one bar. Just few minutes ago tried calling for help again but, of course, I can't even understand for all the fading and static. And, of course, live chat only available Monday thru Saturday. Don't know about anyone else, but this is also a major safety issue when only one phone in the household.

If it works then I'll say goodbye to this overpriced, underperforming, throttled after 15GB crap.

It often says waiting for connection which indicates that there are internet brakes and outages. This is causing me a great deal of stress in trying to communicate with my friends. I am in the middle Tennessee area Northwest of Nashville between Nashville and Clarksville Tennessee. Most of my movement has been near Highway 41A and interstate 24 both Northwest of Nashville. I have never had issues like this with cell service in those areas. If this problem is not results soon, I may have to seek other cellular providers for my cell phone service in the future.

4939749576	2020-06-03T22:14:34	ExAppleFan	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I live in rural central Illinois. Last year, we had 4-5 bars on the cell network at home, and the internet was steady, if chronically slow. This year, especially since March, network service has been 1-3 bars at home, we can't stream Netflix or Amazon Prime video, and gaming online that used to be smooth is constantly disconnecting or going into red ping rates.   Verizon is very expensive. When I lived in the city, I had T-Mobile, which was unlimited for $40/month. That service was better on a bad day than Verizon is on a good one. Downloading the last big update this year for Elder Scrolls Online took 5 1/2 days, running 24/7. That's the longest download I've had since dial up!  Internet and cell service in the US is chronically expensive, way underperforming, and never properly addressed. Other countries trump us many times over with internet service alone, and pay less. We all need to vote where it counts, with our dollars, and hold Verizon accountable for not providing the service we're paying way to much money to be screwed over.

I need the internet for my job  as a gig worker through a few different apps and when this extremely ANNOYING, FRUSTRATIING, and INFURIATING problem happens it is interfering with me trying to make a living.  Verizon is blaming the town of Port Orange and their alleged resistance to building/installing new towers.  I'm gonna aim my anger at both sides here.  Get your sh@! in order you aholes, there are a lot of people in the area and a lot of businesses and workers depend on strong, consistent internet connectivity to do their jobs and make a living.

Current problems and outages	Beware that Verizon signs you up with a attractive high data package and then voids it by intentionally claiming that your autopay couldn't go through. They then only allow you back with a lower data package at the same price. This has happened to me twice, my neighbor, and now my physically disabled client. I made sure (we have screenshots) that my client's autopay was enrolled and accepted and sure enough, his phone got cut off with no warning and they claimed he never set up autopay and wasn't going to be allowed the same plan. We have screenshots as proof. Verizon should be sued. That is worse than bait and switch, that is fraud.

Ask for a supervisor. High call volume, no supervisors. Have one call me back OK? That never happened.   Oh. Did I tell you they told me I needed a new phone, that's why my phone internet is so slow. OK. Bought a new phone, deja Vu all over again. So I am leaving Boost-shitt-Sprint-crap service forever. Bye. Bye. Bye.

It stops working inside the home Or building. It switches between no more than 2 bars to No Service. Callers can’t hear when a call does go through, takes forever to get a call to go through, text messages and pictures will not send. The only way to operate the phone inside of any home or building is with WIFI calling. I have reported it to Verizon 6 times they refuse to acknowledge a problem and they have yet to fix it. Seems like it will never be fixed since no one wants to even admit that there is a problem. Looks like I have no choice but to switch carriers after 17years.

They are in their 80s and driving a mile away to make a phone call is not an option for them.  What are they supposed to do if they have a medical emergency?
4988209066	2020-07-11T17:56:33	disqus_UDXmeDTogg	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Verizon Wireless 4Glte signal strength has been on a steady decline for months now and it is occurring in areas which have had the strongest signals to date. I am referring to Pittsburgh, Oakmont, Penn Hills, Natrona Heights and so on. When calling customer service they claim there is nothing wrong and I am falsely reporting even with screen shots proving the signal bars at a steady 2 bars or even switching to 3g service believe it nor not. I cant believe with the technology out there we are even having these issues. It's because they are shutting down towers to save money but continue to raise prices. They have a pure monopoly on the phone service and know we cant switch to the far inferior sprint or boost mobile.

4990418105	2020-07-13T16:23:15	disqus_iYys2KXE49	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	We live in Westchester CA, 90045. On Friday July 10th, all the Verizon phones in our house went from strong signal to "No Service" although we could still receive texts (sporadically). I drove a few miles away to Culver City to talk to a Verizon human employee. After he acknowledged that the fact that I could speak to him on my phone meant that my phone was not the issue, he opened a ticket. On Sunday July 12th I received a text stating that my ticket was "assigned and being worked". This morning, July 13th, still without  service, I received a new text stating that the "reported service issue is complete" and to click on http://www.vzw.com/signal "to see more details." As you can see, the video features a Verizon spokesman to "educate you and the options available to you" and randomly says that the signal strength "in your reported area is less than optimal". At least my wife and I had a laugh about it as we are looking for other options. We have a feeling that our experience with Verizon is the rule rather than the exception and may have to go back to a landline and give up our cellphones. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad!

Phone freezes constantly and internet loads very slowly.  Rebooted, removed all background info and reset network and it still happens. We live in Naples, Fl. I just learned from my daughter who heard from a friend who lives in Naples that we have a tower down but no alert from Verizon sent to let us know. Also since our senior unlimited plan was started I think Verizon throttles us at certain times because we have trouble in the evening with our phone.  Also, I made an appointment for these issues since I got an E-mail about getting support so I went and was let in the store and told they no longer have tech support. How crazy is that?  When  I made the appointment it had an area to describe what was going on and I explained the issues. No one contacted me ahead to say we do not do tech support anymore. If you call Verizon, plan to read War and Peace because of the long wait you will have.  Very bad customer service.

It's been over three days without a phone, voicemail, texts or the Verizon app. How can you even get emergency assistance during Hurricane Laura aftermath without phone service? What are the changes of getting a refund on your monthly bill? Probably as good as making a phone call right now. Oh, and just for your information Verizon, my zip code is 70605. That's right smack dab in the middle of HURRICANE LAURA's path in Lake Charles, LA - since you seem to be so clueless. Why not tell the truth that you routed a tower via semi on I10 almost 3 days ago and it is still not up and running. Entergy, Suddenlink and the water company are working faster than you. Hey guys, we're talking about a phone signal for God's sake.

Glad I didn't put all my eggs in one lame basket, i.e. internet, phone, t.v.!  AT&T "Ma Bell" is looking good right now, especially since VZ does not offer FiOS in our location either!  The U.S. is starting to resemble Venezuela, a third world nation while China continues to rapidly pass us by with new infrastructure, high speed trains etc.  Unlike ScAMTRACK whose top speed is only 75mph!

Current problems and outages	My cellular phone has had poor service in my home for over 2 months now.  The only way someone can hear me clearly is when I go outside and even that was not effective today.. When I speak with representatives from Verizon, they have no explanation as to why this is happening, especially when historically this was never the case.  I have been a Verizon customer for over 10 years and have never had this problem before.  I believe there is a correlation between my poor cellular connection and the storm that took place several weeks ago, but according to Verizon, there were no power outages reported.  I am at my wits end.  I am trying to work from home, but that has become next to impossible!!!!  Mind you, I am still expected to pay full price for this poor service that is giving me nothing but aggravation.

Impossible for me to call anyone or answer any calls. Working from home is impossible because I need my phone to do so. I had a job interview yesterday which was VERY frustrating because I could hardly make out the questions. Call dropped on her. Luckily the number was displayed so I could call her back and deeply apologize. It was a work from home job that I really wanted soooooo she might not call back feeling the reception is horrible in my area. Tried to open my app...Could not do so...I have to drive away from my house to use my phone. Paying over $200.00 per month for this! Contacted Verizon via chat twice and they can't see any issues in my area. Right! With a generic reply we will look into it and it can take 3-5 business days. So for now I have a very expensive paperweight. Thanks!!

5067138503	2020-09-11T23:25:27	shanalachellelee	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	ok so I've got some major issues going on with Verizon. Firstly my husband's phone hasn't worked since August 21st. We contacted Verizon on the 22nd and every day since then. We have been hung up on, lied to, pushed and shoved around and I've even been cussed out. We had an NRB ticket submitted August 22 for the technical issues going on. Which are no data, no service. Initially it was like a switch being flipped on and off every 5-15 minutes. From 1 bar 3g, 2 bar 4g, but mainly no service and 1 bar. Every time i have called i get rude customer service. Like they are horrible and just don't want to do their respective jobs. Before all this happened we had always had perfect signal in this same exact locations. But its honestly like Verizon packed up and left and just didn't care to inform their customers. We have been told that it is a tower down, we are roaming, we are connect to an AT&T tower, we are being bounced to a tower over an our away, that it is the Sim Card, that it's a panel on a tower. We cant get a straight answer to save our lives.. I'm sick of it and we are about to leave Verizon for good.. BTW this is Central Georgia area. 31061 (milledgeville)

I may go to att I don’t like being lied to at all to get me to pay more money I have medical issues and with seniors they play on that because we need our phones.  I’m in Florida and it started on Wednesday night September 30 th 2020 I was on the phone yesterday for over 3 hours one person hung up on me another was a manager who put me on hold for 47 minutes until I hung up and called back I jumped through all the hoops with trouble shooting why??? If they know there’s an issue why put you through jumping through the hoops of resetting networks going into setting turning off WiFi turning this off that off restarting the phone etc: it’s BS that we jump through hoops when all they need to say is I’m sorry Verizon is experiencing technical issues now I’m paying more and I have no better service

Her landline is sending an error message when trying you try to call out. Error message, "the number you have reached is not in service at this time". Sitting in the house, my mom and I have received incoming calls from people calling my grandmother's landline number. Verizon's Tech's suggestion was for everyone who calls to open a ticket with our selective phone carrier's -_-  It's clearly a Verizon issue since we've been seeing trucks working on the phone lines throughout the area. Welcome to 5G!!!! -_-  Her phone started glitching like this yesterday at 5pm.

5147075905	2020-11-11T08:38:27	disqus_OEEWTcZmtG	istheservicedown	Verizon outage or service down? Current problems and outages	No phone or internet as of 1:50 A.M., 11/11/20... Once again verizon has shown the absolute ineptitude they've become famous for, at least here on long island... no accidents, no bad weather, no reason for no service, especially since they upgraded, according to them, their infrastructure 2 weeks ago, when there was no service at all for three days with no advance warning. Verizon is very good at taking your money, they're awful at providing the internet, phone, and customer service they're suppossed to provide after they take your money. Will another telecommunications company please move in on them, and push them out of long island? All you have to do is provide the same services Verizon ALLEGES to provide, you just have to actually provide them, and charge a fair price. Also, make sure your customer service reps speak ENGLISH, and they're reachable anytime, unlike the 7pmm cutoff verizon currently has, btw, that's IF you aren't hung up on after at least an hour wait. Do that, and you will CRUSH Verizon. Long Islanders await your arrival, it is time for verizon TO GO!!!
