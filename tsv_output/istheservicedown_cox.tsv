Please be patient as repairs are being made.

4284594340	2019-01-14T01:52:59	prime9891	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I'm so tired of this. I don't know WTF is going on with Cox in the past 2 months in Metairie, LA but it's just unacceptable. Signal dropping CONSTANTLY, especially in the middle of football games. Both cable and Internet going out at the SAME TIME, which mean's there's something wrong with their nodes or other infrastructure on the utility poles, and it never seems to change. Some days nothing happens, then the next day it goes out again multiple times. It's strange because months ago there were hardly any issues that I noticed, but now every single day I'm watching tv / on the Internet and the cable signal goes out, and so does the Internet.   We have also been in an outage almost every single day, despite the signals coming back usually 5 or so minutes as the outage begins, it's crazy. I check the webpage every time it goes out and there's a reported outage in my area, which means Cox won't send out techs the next day if you call them. I cannot wait for AT&T to install fiber in my neighborhood so I can ditch Cox's awful service for good.

Anyone heard anything about their service?  Some reviews seem to indicate people are very happy with them.    Funny how Cox is ready to pounce on you if you go one byte over their limit but I have seen nothing from them on offering compensation for not only the outage itself which last time was over 24 hours but the inconvenience.

4344682589	2019-02-19T15:16:36	unavailable	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Cox management should be replaced in total.  They have scheduled planned area-wide outages affecting the 70817 zip code continually for the last month.  Total blackout again today 2-19-19.  Support knows there's an outage, but has no information other than it's planned.  You'd think management would have the basic intelligence to notify their support teams what's going on with continual planned outages.  It would also seem pretty basic to send some kind of communication to the customer base being affected so they would at least understand why planned outages are being continually scheduled.

Really getting frustrated. I'm sure they will say it's my equipment that is the problem because I no longer rent their modem. But I tested my equipment for a while before I turned their modem back in so that's not the issue. I don't doubt that it's because I'm not renting theirs anymore and they want that money back.

4434681629	2019-04-23T13:41:07	barbaraayates	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Have basically had no internet connection since Sunday.  It was off and on all weekend, but Sunday and yesterday, nada.  I had a hard time even paying Cox.  With this kind of horrible service, it might just be time to go to ATT, I know they are slower, but slower is better than nothing.  And, paying $105 a month for service about 50% of the time.  But, I have fought with them and they are always right, so maybe it is time to say bye bye to Cox.  I live in a poorer section of town and I really believe that is why the service is so bad, they are throttling back the bandwidth.  I must have internet and after two days of nothing, I am calling ATT this very minute.  You had your chance Cox and you have proven over and over again that you just do not care. Adios....  I also expect Cox to take off this past Sunday and yesterday from my bill.  But, they won't as they expect you to call and hold for hours ... we are being punished for using Cox, and as I see below, looks like Cox is unacceptable all over......let's kick then to the curb.

Current problems and outages	Internet in Owasso, OK has been flaky for 2 days now. 300/30 (down/up) service tops out at about 200/5 per speedtest.net -- often less than that.    Of more impact is that a number of sites I access regularly cannot be accessed. Firefox returns "The page isn’t redirecting properly. Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete. This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies." The web console shows 302 (temporary) redirects looping between the site in question and IP 184.178.98.85 -- an IP address allocated to Cox. The same sites can be accessed with no problems using my phone (using mobile data, not WiFi).     The problem is affecting some sites consistently (although occasionally a given site may be accessible for a while) while other sites are not affected.     Both the modem and router (separate devices) have been power cycled with no change.   For those reporting Internet outages, are you experiencing similar problems?

I call for support and they say there is not an outage in my area.  They want me to book an apt w/ a tech and they say it will cost me $75. if it is not a Cox issue but if I sign up to pay for support, ($10. a month), the tech will be free.  It sure seems like a lot of people are down for it just to be my equipment!!  :c (
4489341480	2019-06-04T19:00:22	unavailable	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Internet went down early morning June 4th. I called Cox tech. Tech told me no outages, my modem must have died. Told me only 1 specific modem would work for my business acct and could get at Best Buy. I drove to BB to pick up modem. Returned, plugged in, call tech back to register new modem. Now told outage in my area, probably not my modem. Very frustrating for the money we pay. Poor customer tech service!

4489623014	2019-06-04T23:07:43	disqus_gLy0N63RsV	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Since there are so many recent comments coming from the SouthWest area of USA, figured I’d add some more.   The last two weeks for internet in Vegas have been unstable and overall poor. I work from home so I see outages impact immediately because my VPN gets dropped and calls VOIP drop, which then drops my customers. I’ve called Cox tech support almost each time this happens, which is at least 6, not including today, and the responses are incredibly vague and unhelpful.   There was some generic literature sent out by Cox via snail mail a few weeks ago about network upgrades happening in Vegas soon, but it didn’t advise that internet would be up and down so often.  I plan to cut and/or downgrade Cox services shortly. For the amount of money paid each month, this type of service is unacceptable.

As often as our service is interrupted and for the length of time it seems to take to fix, they should be forced to make adjustments on bills. If I don't pay the full bill you can bet they'd come after me. Sick of this. ALL cable companies stink.

4508025619	2019-06-19T13:40:27	bellarobinson	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Internet was down for an outage in West Warwick yesterday 6/18/2019 from 10am to 4pm, now this morning it doesn't work again. Now I am on hold with cox. Before I called Cox, I reset my modem and rebooted my computer. I work from home and already missed a full work day yesterday. They NEVER offer any discounts for these inconveniences, and this happens at least 3 or 4 times a year. I could understand if we had bad weather or a storm. If they tell me it will take 3 days to send someone out, I will lose my shit.  OK the lady comes back after 7 minutes and then tells me that the are not responsible for my wifi, and she wants to know can I connect by hardwire, LIKE WTF who has hard wire set up's anymore. The lady is rude, she takes no responsibility, she LIES and says that there is not an outage again today, yet I can see 69% of people in Warwick have their internet down right now. They REFUSE to send anyone to fix it until tomorrow at 10am. The lady doesn't care that this is costing me 3 day of paid work, because I work from home.  I am calling Verizon and changing service providers. The women I spoke to should be fired immediately for being rude, and refusing to get my service restored on the same day. 10 minutes later my internet magically works again. COX service is horrible.
4508150808	2019-06-19T15:16:37	unavailable	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I like how they want you to tell them how long you have been out of/interupted service. In my area we are every time you look up; we are in some sort of outage. They are piss poor and are not competive at all, because they know the only choice we have in my area is Direct TV or them. I pay 150.00 a month just for internet and the contour app only, which is rediculous! The only reason why I stay is because I would still have to use them for internet and they will go up on the price, because I would only have one service with them. It's a shame how these companies are allowed to take advantage the way they do.

Cox's online support agent denied any outage, then ran me through the standard rigamarole of blaming my wifi router, having me power cycle my modem, resetting my modem, and finally ended up blaming the modem as faulty and telling me to contact the modem manufacturer for assistance, then tried to sell me an 'upgraded modem'.  The modem worked fine this morning. :-/

Current problems and outages	It’s been four days with an unexplainable outage with Cox Enterprises. Is it true that Google Fiber has something to do with all of the cox outages? Is this due to continued lawsuits between cox and Google Fiber. Cox is blocking Google Fiber from offering internet in mine and probably your city too. Faster internet and flat reasonable pricing. It seems like a game changer that Google is willing to put up a fight for. For now, I guess we will have to put up with the short end of there debacle.

Current problems and outages	I live along the Lorton Fairfax Station border and we have been down for internet phone and tv now almost 24 hours. Very frustrated can’t get any answers when I call customer service. Just text messages saying it will be resolved in 2 and 4 hour windows only to be disappointed when it is not. At least they could tell us what the problem is and a realistic estimate on when it will be fixed!  Time to explore FIOS.

Customer support ran “package” test and only half made it. However, when the technician showed up; over 2hrs late, all they did was give me yet another box.

Sites that would load in a fraction of a second now routinely take 10-60 seconds to load. most attempted site visits result in a time out of one type or another. I have cleared buffers & caches, eliminated temporary files, upgraded and rebooted my router and run speed tests. Download speeds for the majority of the speed tests were in the 60 KBS range instead of MPS yet, occasionally a speed test does show 6-7 MBS. So, the problem seems sporadic with occasional bursts of normality. This is in Surprise, 85387

We have multiple times per day when our internet is disrupted.  It is totally frustrating.  I have filled out two very negative surveys and never had anyone contact me.

I went to my SmartTV to link back up to NETGEAR21 but the service was no where to be found. I called back and the Agent took me some reboot steps but no success.  I had to put in a ticket to have a service rep come out which I was informed could possibly cost me $75.  I am like wow; this is not good business.  :(

I have both Century Link and Cox I have 1tb with cox and yet they never make the effort to satisfy customers. You should at least notify people before working on your cheap and slow connection  people have schools and businesses you take monthly payments when you never provide full 24hrs services and never refund the time wasted on your part....  I honestly have high respect for CenturyLink they always give discounts and never in 5 years have I had a problem such as this they do everything to make it work and if they don't they charge you less to make it up I would never be apart of cox if CenturyLink had a 1tb speed....

Current problems and outages	To whom it may concern, if anyone at all at Cox Communication, I’d like to start by saying how disappointed I am in the fact that not only do you have the absolute worst internet/WiFi stability, but your company refuses to compensate their customers! I have had in and out WiFi for months, and I’ve had plenty of days/nights without any service what so ever. As a student who’s also working a full time job, I depend on these services for emails, coursework, studying, and even to come home and unwind to a movie, but with Cox and their more than unsatisfactory service, all activities have become impossible. Why are these outages lasting for weeks? Why are they not being fixed? Why are we not being compensated?! Why charge so much for such poor communications?! And with that being said, I hope to be reached out to. I hope for the situation to be addressed fully, and I hope all of the people paying Cox their hard earned paychecks will be taken care of properly.  #coxpoorcommunications #outagesTOoutrage  Sincerely, your very displeased customer.

As well, and as usual, network interruptions with 0 bytes per second download speeds, almost like a Denial of Service Attack. Interruptions in downloads that sometimes resolve themselves if I reset the download. Read that internet companies had been resetting packs on P2P networks, maybe their doing it on HTTP downloads as well. Where's the FCC when you need them? Net neutrality out the window? We pay their bills!! We're the reason they sit where they sit, where's the loyalty?

It took me telling them I would go to BBB to get an immediate result. That result was, "Sir, we broke a cable... we are fixing it". I think someone in the Ocean trawled and broke it. Oh well.

4637887987	2019-10-02T23:39:20	disqus_tOPVhHDSSv	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I called Cox once again.  This time made service tech appointment because of frustration. Then... I told myself, I can fix this issue. I FIXED the issue even after all the CS and nonsense. After pinging and tracert and other "stuff", I knew it was a small but hidden secret. I just had to find it. SOLUTION for Cox cable box not connecting to TV: unplug the coaxial cable and power to [ ALL CABLE BOXES IF MORE THAN 1 in the house] the cable box, and your TV. Let sit for 30 minutes or longer, is better. Then power on the TV, then plug in the coaxial cable to box, then plug in the power cable to Cox cable box. Turn on TV. The issue is that if you have more than 1 cable box in the house, BOTH need to be simutaneously unplugged and disconnected so the Cox Router will reset the data log on the router on the Cox server. That is my best guess. But it worked. No thanks to COX. I really did not want a service tech to try to scam my elderly father out of saved earnings. I can only imagine all those that get taken. SMILES!

The internet has been consistently down today Friday October 25th since 10:30 I'm a 30-year Cox customer first time ever I'm considering dumping them.  not because their services out but because none of their customer service reps that I've spoken to or texted with over the last five days has been able to give me any type of a straight answer about why the outage is happening and when it is expected to stop for good.  $70 a month high-speed internet service cost I expect that someone can tell me when I can expect my internet to be up to par.

We have checked with everyone to see if we can get a different internet provider however no one with the speed I need. Keep in mind COX what goes around comes around. You can't keep doing this to customers without having someone else come in with internet and TV that works. By far the worst customer service I have had to deal with.

I've been using LTE to communicate. Destroyed my bill already. Yes, I intend to "ask" for bill to be severely reduced and make up my LTE overages. I expect actual answer's to my questions.

I was told from a friend that worked for sprint that Cox is changing out all the copper cables in the valley (in sections) and replacing them with fiberoptics. This may be the issue where you are as well.  The contour boxes are not converting over the new signals like they (Cox) thought it would. Now that tells me that soon, when all copper cables have been replaced, they will be saying everyone 'should upgrade' to the newest and latest boxes! Just my guess but I don't think I am far off!

Current problems and outages	Cox is down again today, now in the double-digits, and that's JUST today. Up and down, every day, but worse than usual today. Like me, log your complaints with the FCC consumer complaint website - the only improvements Cox and other monopolies make, they'll only make when they're forced to by consumer-protecting regulatory oversight. Until then, you're Cox's punk.

I have literally never experienced this level of incompetent internet provider service until I moved to Mesa which is monopolized by COX. Congress should focus on a COX antitrust instead of an Alphabet or Facebook one and they should force you to make more competition in this area. Actually I’m writing my congressman now and everyone else should write their congressmen and representatives too!

My WIFI and TV are out; so, I can't watch TV. I just upgraded to Gigablast, but haven't picked up the Gigablast equipment. I have been putting up with some of the worst internet I have ever experienced.  I had COMCA$T in Denver ($88 per month).  They were always rated around 45 out of 50 in customer service, but once online, I rarely lost connection like I do with Cox which. is costing me $108.79 per month and I am constantly having to reboot my modem, which is only 28 months in service (practically brand new). This business tonight has me rethinking Gigablast. Perhaps, I will cancel Gigablast on Monday. Why pay more to have Shtty service ($120 per month for 12 months) when I can get shtty service for $109.79 per month. Also, I might just cancel Cox on Tuesday. This is internet at its worst! Cox is the Dish TV of broadband!

There solution was to send out a tech for $75 or for $10 a month I could call a tech anything for free.  Then they wanted to have me sign up for 9 movie channels for $5 a month.  Why not just fix the problem of lost signal.  Before I moved here I had time warner and never needed a tech in 12 years but coxs solution is for $10 a month you can have him come out anytime for free.

They never admit that the outage is due to them upgrading their service, or simply just apologize for the poor service that they are currently providing on their end.

Current problems and outages	I just moved to Surprise  AZ from San Diego CA HOPING PRAYING  that I could have a better service here than I was getting in San Diego.  I am really REALLY disappointed! It's about the same.  I continually get intermittent internet signals all day!  I decided that I was not going to get cable due to the extreme frustration of constant dropping of connections.   It seems that COX has too many customers and way too big service areas to maintain and cant keep up with the demand.   Perhaps they should STOP selling their services and fix ALL of the issues!  I cant stand that I am paying for a service that is not being received!!

Tip for customers: if you live in an apartment or are on a shared account Cox will try to redirect you to a third-party technician who will give you very basic tips that you can find for free online anywhere, and the off-site redirect IS a paid service which is very not cool, considering tech-support among any respectable service provider is a standard feature.  Yes, I understand that with administrative account keys you have access to TS, but AGAIN, those are not available to those of us with a property-managed account or who are beneficiaries of an account with no access to Keys.

Nothing has worked... VERY FRUSTRATING, as I do live podcasts and game streaming and am constantly getting dropped from servers and stream connections.

Internet issues for weeks now, this is typical for Cox as the infrastructure is so far out of date and in need of vast upgrades. COX has dodged FCC violations with every excuse in the book, first and foremost they blame customer equipment to buy time, then it's routine for COX to send a person to your house to do nothing to buy more time. COX advertisements claim they are the best, that's a lie and it needs to stop. The last visit at my house COX replaces the incoming line from their box to my house for packet loss. COX packet loss is an infrastructure issue and has been an issue for SEVERAL YEARS due to lack of major upgrades to their residential infrastructure. Did I say "Infrastructure" enough, nothing will change folks because COX isn't investing in the correct area of their.... wait for it...... INFRASTRUCTURE!

4860147176	2020-04-04T01:10:04	disqus_Nxnz7gAfen	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Area code 85719 in Tucson. Beginning about 3/28/29, like clockwork, I start getting repeated disconnects from 9am to about 530PM. After that it's fine, and I'm able to surf the web and streaming movies like normal until around 9AM the next morning. My Cox app originally indicated an outage with a repair time, but since then it just says that they've noticed a temporary outage and are trying to repair it. I wouldn't mind it so much except that when I call tech support to at least get some kind of update, they just try to sell me a service upgrade or a new cable modem that I don't need.  With the Chinese coronavirus, I don't expect things to be working very well, but at least have your tech support give honest answers rather than sell snake oil. I'm seriously thinking of switching to CenturyLink because of this. They seem to have much better customer reviews.

4869759859	2020-04-11T02:33:29	disqus_MmHEhrZC23	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I'm ready for Cox to come up with an explanation for the outage today, April 10 in West Phoenix. Earlier in the day they reported on their phone app that it would be fixed at 5:29 pm. It was down and out most of the day, then came back at a much-throttled slower speed later in the afternoon. Then, at 5:29 right on the dot it came back up to speed.   Now, I absolutely do not believe in coincidences. Until I hear differently I'm going to believe that Cox is performing rolling outages to alleviate bandwidth over-usage by all of the work-at-homers and Netflix watchers who are home because of the virus panic.   5:29 on the dot? Come on!   To make matters worse, Verizon chose today to upgrade its cell phone towers in Phoenix for 5G, so cell phone calling was out too. We didn't have the option to use wifi-calling because, guess what, Internet was down.   My wife and I are both working at home, and I'm going to be VERY unhappy if these outages continue and we lose our jobs.

Current problems and outages	I live in fountain Hills AZ 85268 we are repeatedly getting outages from approximately 11:45 to 6 PM every day. We are repeatedly told by the customer service “techs” that it’s our modem and it’s not their equipment. Bought a new modem and the tech that was trying to help us set it up couldn’t get it working and said we do not have a problem with our modem that there is a outage on their end. But the customer service continues to lie to us about there not being outages and it is our equipment that has problem. Garbage customer service And lack of accountability.

No answers from Cox or estimated time.  Poor communication.  Guess it’s time for a hotel and new provider if I want to remain employed during a pandemic.  I can guess my bill and their expectations of me will remain the same.  I’m expected to be considerate and patient but would Cox extend the same courtesy if I couldn’t pay?
5023635456	2020-08-09T11:14:32	unavailable	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	It’s been 6 days with no tv or internet.  No communication with estimated time. I called yesterday at 545 and was told it was scheduled to be restored at 549.  Still nothing.  My question for Cox is this.  We know this is an unexpected event and 6 days is extensive when one relies on internet to work during a pandemic and it’s unlikely we will see a reduction in our bill but would Cox extend the same courtesy to their customers who might find themselves unable to pay their large monthly bill?  Would Cox shut down my services if I don’t pay? If yes then all their customers should abandon them as well.

It really is time for Cox to be held accountable for their  lack of service pertaining to our Internet/ cable.  In my opinion the company is out of control such as  Ever Source. Might I suggest we let our voices be heard- call your Senators/Representatives and complain; picket peacefully outside of their locations. Any other suggestions are greatly appreciated. Let’s all stop the complaining and do something about it!!

Current problems and outages	Cox down in Oklahoma city most of the day since Thursday they said on my end. Sick of Cox blaming everyone for their internet being down. 4 days I have reached out to chat a dozen times had the agents end the chat reset my modem tell me there is no issue in my area. My neighbors and I went door to door asking people in a 17 block radius if they had Cox internet the ones that said yes says their service isn't working right or not at all. Contacted Cox let them know this they didn't care. There is a petition going around okc to get another cable and internet provider here because of these issues so far I have refused to sign it but i am at the point of signing it..i work from home I need my internet as some breadwinner for my family. Since January 4th I've made numerous tech request they keep getting cancelled by Cox not by me at all I don't find out they are cancelled.till I get a.notice in my email. Since Jan 4th I've made 19 tech request that never showed up or were cancelled on Cox end. I have a service request for Sept 1st hopefully they call me and show up. Not to mention I have requested supervisors or managers and have been denied to speak with one. My best friend works with Cox she told me they can not refuse a supervisor request. I asked if she could help me.she said no as she works in the retention department which I understand but this is out of hand.

Occasional outages but mostly slow wildly unstable speeds. Don't even get half of what we're paying for and it's fluctuating constantly. Trying to stream to Twitch results in the bitrate jumping between 6000 and 0. Everything's fine on Cox's speedtests, chances are there's a node getting a ton of noise ruining the connection. I imagine Cox is doing little to fix it though.
5067962903	2020-09-12T18:31:57	atcomputers	istheservicedown	Cox Communications outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I always recommend to do separate units. Double check with coax on what their current approved DOCSIS cable modems are for whatever service you have, never hurts to plan for future upgrades. You can also save money by buying a used or refurbished one, standalone modems rarely go bad.  As far as routers I don't ever recommend consumer grade anymore. They're set for ease of use and speed and gaming and not really security. depending on how technologically advanced you are you may be able to do a lot better with an SMB or SOHO device. PF sense/netgate, microtic, ubiquity. they all have a much deeper learning curve than it's consumer grade one but they have far more options and security features available.

The Cox idiot tried to tell me that they're  a "Public Utility" so there's nothing consumers can do. Bull. I called the Kansas Public Utilities Commission to inquire about their status as a 'Public Utility". They're not. What they told me is they'd like to be so they can hide behind this sort of problem. What they are is a pseudo utility....in other words however they may think of themselves, they're just another business hoping for our dollars and doing little to get them. I tried to call their headquarters in Atlanta, found there was no number. Called the local Police who called the 'corporate number' they had, got an 'agent' in Twin Falls, Idaho. With that, they sent a car with officers by to 'make sure' they were alright. Seems giving the PD a false number annoys them....I finally got an 'internal' number but they were very unhappy. Here's a comparison; A large corporation here, in Wichita, employs 160,000 people. I can dial their headquarters and get it....maybe they'd like to swallow Cox...without a burp.

We’ve made a lot of progress reconnecting the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Sally and expect to have most customers back online by Friday, 9/25. There is more extensive work to be done in Perdido Key, Southwest Escambia County, Cantonment, plus other small pockets where our network infrastructure was more heavily damaged. In those harder hit areas, you may experience longer restoration times, as we work to repair more severely damaged network equipment. We will email you when services are restored in your area."

We understand we had damaged lines from Hurricane Sally and we have been patient.  All other friends & family have had cable back for a week now and seems we were forgotten.  The frustrating thing is we have had no communication from the Communications people (COX)  One rep tells us one thing, another rep tells us something else.  One rep sent a tech out after I told her not to because I knew we had lines down.  He came anyway and it was a waste of his time. It would not be so frustrating  if we had an estimate time.  Everyday coming home from work, well are we going to have TV or not?  Do we make plans to stay home or go watch the ballgame at a friends.  I have been patient long enough!!

I lost it last Tuesday, and our school district is having to designate some of this week as inclement weather days because teachers and students ALL do not have internet. I have seen 1, again just 1, Cox communication truck but dozens of OG&E crews out in the streets. How has my power been on all week but I still have no estimated time for my internet to be on?

Cox said it was back up on October 31st. Call support since I still had no internet. Cox support said my modem was bad and to call Arris. I told the cox rep it was a signal issue and not my modem. A day later, we went back on the outage list. Neighbors have been told between November 12 - 15 before Cox services is restored. Cox is using generators in other areas as a workaround until service is back up. Cox isn't do that for my area. My wife and I both work from home and I attend online classes. Can't do either without internet. We tried using our mobile hotspot, but due to the cellular traffic, its way too slow. I'm shocked that Cox doesn't have some type of disaster recovery plan for these situations. I guess blaming the electric companies is their disaster recovery plan.
