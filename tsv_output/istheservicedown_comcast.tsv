Current problems and outages	Internet in Tacoma Washington down for over a week now. @comcastcares Comcast doesn't really care, been transferred everytime I call, try to troubleshoot saying internet works. Cannot connect due to DHCP. Have a brand new laptop straight from the store never been used and Comcast says all internet is good and it's all my electronics. They lie and make you feel bad for their faulty service blaming it on you. Sick of their rude call service and their complete lack of responsibility. Only way to fix it is if people stop using them so Comcast is forced to change and adapt. But people most likely won't actually stop using them. I know for sure I'm done though.

You all do know thats why this is here...right?  No one will ever see this but the very angry people talking to other very angry people! I don't usually do this but...I just came to let it out!  First noticed the crazy last night from about 12am-3am (study hours) All day Netflix and cable channels were glitchy, if with a picture at all (picture looked like the end of the VHS tapes at grandmas) with inconsistent streaming. I thought to myself at that moment,"this smart tv is no longer smart..got it!!" Wanted to give COM-SCAT the benefit of the doubt...(because they are the best ;) Noticed it again today around 12pm and again around 5pm. I troubleshooted the hell out of everything in this house and still either very slow or nonexistent WiFi. Cable continues to spoof us, the kids have gone AWOL...and I have a 3000 word paper due at Midnight. Called the great service reps and received great news that this great problem will be fixed in less than 45 great mins. He was as generous to offer to "call me" if the problem was resolved sooner.... 3 great hours later.....On behalf of my family we would like to give COM-SCAT a big THUMBS UP for the wonderful service. We don't even care about what's wrong its happens so often we know you guys have this one in the bag! Get it together or move out the way!! #COM-SCAT

It Went out at about 2-2:30 am on January 6th and hasn't come back on even though they keep showing an "update" on their website that says the service will be restored within 3 hours or they throw a random time at you like "2:07am" then that time just passes on by and still no service. An actual UPDATE would be great Comcast! Like for instance, WHEN you will be working in the area or how many places are ahead of us before you work in the area or how long before you begin working in the area or if you already are working in the area! A little information would definitely be great! You guys won't even give your customers the time of day to take their call and answer a couple quick questions!, you just expect us to take the false estimated times your service operator/website "update" throws at us and run with it as if we could count on that to be correct! If you want to KEEP your customers then I highly recommend that you at least keep us up to date with ACCURATE information regarding the service we are paying you for otherwise expect alot of unhappy customers that have had enough of the BS and would rather go with a new cable company. That's all.

Really the past few weeks, month almost now there have been SO many times out Internet has been down. I rely on our internet for work, my daughter does school 100% online and it puts a burden on the rest of the family when they’re expecting to be able to use WiFi and it’s not working properly. I’ve contacted Comcast and the rep said they don’t get any information regarding the outages, when they’ll happen, how long they’ll last for, or when everything will finally be up and running Iike it used to.  <b></b> My daughter missed ANOTHER full day of school and I had to explain to my employer that I’m unable to work AGAIN today because our internet is down once again this week. <b></b> I know Comcast isn’t the cheapest provider out there and I was willing to pay more because at the time, they were the the best. Not so much anymore.  I’m thinking it might be time to switch ISP’s.

4288157510	2019-01-16T02:40:57	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Comcast was one of the companies that claimed to be a "title 2" communications company and excepted billions of dollars in tax money for upgrades in infrastructure so we'd get better speeds and they just sat on that money. When asked about them upgrading they claimed to not be title 2 but when they try to put lines on private property they claimed to be title 2 again. Just another corporate monopoly using sitting on stolen tax dollars.

They'll illegally break onto your property to install lines claiming title 2 but when you tell them they need to install upgraded lines with the money they were given they say they aren't title 2.

YUP no shit they do shit like this so unaware customers have non functional equipment replaced and they lock you into another 2 years when we all have planned on dropping service next time dishnetwork runs a special. if only the pricks at dish would offer a decent plan they would get 90% of all comcast customers except the people so stupid they cannot do the math and realize the money they would save

4300285981	2019-01-21T18:03:17	disqus_FhDksEbDzP	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Seattle internet is so broken that it is actually working just fine but somehow the network is reporting failures without having tried to do what you asked. What I mean is, I have a ping to Google's DNS, and every single second of the day it says it's getting answers back from that ping. So I switch my system to use Google's DNS ... but Comcast is cutting off those DNS requests. Ping, it lets through just fine... DNS lookups, the network tells me to f--- off. These are happening simultaneously, Comcast's network is reporting DNS failure even though that same network is reporting ping success. This can't be incompetence, only deliberate effort can make an internet connection work only halfway this consistently. Comcast is deliberately toying with its customer base to see how bad the reaction will be when they don't give what they're being paid for. This is 3 steady months of service degradation in central district Seattle, and this city's internet service was never good to begin with compared to other places I've lived. I'm pretty sure 99% of rural s--tholes in this country have better internet than Seattle does. I had internet in 1999 suburban Kansas better than what you get in 2019 central Seattle. So f---ing pathetic. At this point whenever I move in the future I will make sure Comcast doesn't have a monopoly on internet infrastructure before I move there, because anyone paying Comcast at this point is either trapped, or a moron.

I don't know if they cut over to a new code level that's super buggy, or trying to force too much into existing bandwidth. <b>HINT: If you recorded a show and can't watch it, go to "Episodes" and see if there is an "On Demand" option - at least ABC and CBS seem to make these available next day. You won't be able to FF over the commercials, but you can get your series' next episode and bring your blood pressure down a bit.</b> Their DVR really sucks, in general. Also, there seems to be a growing (sometimes HUGE) variance in audio volume levels between some channels over the last however many months - very annoying. One channel need to turn the volume up all the way, and switch to a different channel and it's blaring.

Contacted Comcast who stated this was just an inconvenience to us the customer.  What???  They said they can come out next week.  Really????  Piss poor service!!!!

I am so tired of it, but I need it. They know and that is why they are in no hurry to fix it. When you hold the monopoly, you can afford to not care.

Something is wrong for Comcast to not comment as severe and widespread as this outage seems to be?!!?    @comcast “Please, you owe your customers better and more frequent updates and service than this!!!”   Every call, chat or communication to Comcast and Xfinity goes to a foreign call center where the staff although friendly can’t and are not able to say or find out anything !!! Comcast owes everyone a significant refund on this one in addition to an Inconcenience credit on their next bill! But you also need to inform us exactly “what the heck is going on!”

Is anyone else having outages in LR? Xfinity tech staff came on Tuesday and changed modem. Internet worked again, but next day it went out again, this time with the red light on the top of the modem. Short periods of internet working for 30 mintues to a few hours, then going out again. Online service doesn't help anything because they're in India. They offered to send a repair tech in a week. This is the worst company I've ever dealt with.

My family is so close to get rid of you. Mainly reason the router isn't working all that well is because of not enough towers. Been told Verizon will provide router Wi-Fi soon. They have bunch of towers all over the globe. Soon you will be shutdown. Sorry not sorry. My little niece is bored and all she wants to do is watch Ryan's Toys Review. Thanks Comcast. You make things worst.

Unplugged everything... still nothing.  Paying for horrible service.  Tried calling them and left my number for the call back.  Call back came in and it said to press 1 if I was on the line. Tried 3 times to press 1 and it wouldn't accept it and hung up on me.  I called back and sat in queue for 15 min and then was disconnected.  So ready to get rid of this terrible service that we get charged outrageous monthly amounts for and can't even watch tv.

The wifi goes down consistently every few hours and returns roughly half an hour after it goes out. If it's not an issue with the status and service overall, then the only logical conclusion is that it's with the modem device itself. Every cable is properly attached and installed correctly, so the problem is the device. However Comcast refuses to swap out the device, stating that they need the troubleshoot system to tell them to do so even when I've been having these wifi issues consistently for the past few weeks. They're going to send a technician instead, and I guarantee that nothing will be proved except that the installation is perfectly fine and that the problem is with the device instead. Until Comcast decides to pull the plug and swap devices, I'm certain that these problems will continue.

The fine folks at Comcast had mutlple trucks parked in my driveway last night from 12 to 5 am.  Flashing lights on my bedroom walls, doors being slammed shut, motors starting and stopping, generators running, idle conversation.  But the worst was my dog at the window growling at the strangers out front.  Awesome.  At 5 am I approached the technician and asked what was going on.  He said this kind of repair needs to be done over night so not to upset the customers or interrupt there connection.  How ignorant can a company be.  I  am not with Comcast and was not going to holler at the man on sight. He was just doing his job and the person responsible has a much higher pay grade. The pay grade has nothing to do with intelligence or general decency. Can you imagine me parking in front of one of the Roberts properties at that time of the night, I would be taken away in hand cuffs for just silently breathing there air let alone keep them awake.

4348416431	2019-02-21T20:34:30	pinky_s_mom	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Comcast/Xfinity Internet went down today at 3:00 PM in New Haven, CT, and wasn't up again until 3:20 PM. Couldn't even CALL Comcast, couldn't ring through on their 800 number, and I have AT&T phone service, so it's not like I was trying to use a Comcast line to call Comcast! It's as if their 800 number was down too. Tried twice. I was able to make other calls to other people right after that as a test, so it's not the phone or the AT&T service. I am sadly used to having my Internet service go out in a glitchy way at least a couple of times a week, but not usually in the middle of the afternoon... it usually gags around 5:00 in my building, when people get home from work (if it doesn't just actually go out completely and then recover after a few minutes). And it often has problems on Sunday afternoon. I work at home and often late at night on my computer, so I am used to being messed with by maintenance schedules in the early hours of day, but it seems as if maintenance can come at any time of day now, any day of the week...

Not only are the outages a major problem but when it's working it comes through in waves. I've unfortunately been forced to use Comcast because it's the only one available. Don't waste your time calling the customer service department because they have no clue how the internet works. They will tell you to do  speed test with them and I'm telling you the rig the results. Use an independent service and you will see the real numbers not the ones they falsify. Don't waste your time getting technical about anything because they don't understand. All they do is read from a prewritten statement to answer questions. Comcast is undoubtedly the worse service provider I've ever had. Would love to go to Cox. They aren't that good either but they are the lesser of two evils. From an extremely frustrated customer.<b></b>

I PAID Comcast to have a new router set up- & I'm STILL having issues. The Comcast people on the phone ALWAYS say the SAME bullshit thing over and over again (rather than really dealing with problems and FIXING them)- , "Did you unplug your router, wait a minute, then plug it back in ?" OF COURSE I DID ! That's the FIRST thing I do EVERY SINGLE TIME- because I would rather try & fix it myself- than spend 40 unproductive minutes on the phone with Comcast IT.  Subscribers spend A LOT of money on this service-> so my message to Comcast Management is-> Stop pocketing the profits and ripping off your customers- fix the service you promised us- OR, refund us for every minute of time we cannot access the services you PROMISED to provide and that we have paid HANDSOMELY for !!! 🤬

4357788988	2019-02-28T07:24:23	disqus_dJBemkt7hh	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I know to expect the worst customer service; lying about outages, always blaming equipment that is not rented or purchased from them, overwhelming sales pitches to upgrade, the list goes on...  What I cannot abide is that this corporation continues to take on new projects and services that put people even more frequently into states of anger, feeling unheard and (as usual), ripped off.  Whether it be Netflix, HBO, Prime video or whatever subscription services that Comcast makes available through the TV service, it is even worse now than the "regular" TV and internet outages.  Everything will be fine with all my other channels, yet my subscription service will repeatedly say " internet error"  but no specific error #......even when someone in the house is currently online and we happen to have a an OK signal.  What a crock of #*%@! The subscription service always loads very slow, the voice recognition for name of subscription service doesn't work 80% of the time then shows mostly unrelated/very confused listings indicative of serious software issues.  Shows will suddenly freeze or go black, guide won't work, pressing all the right buttons on the remote, yet nothing gets better. It seems there were no efforts made by Comcast get the bugs out.  I feel as if become a beta tester for them; being required to be a unwitting beta tester for the amount I pay them!   It is just more of the same absence of effort.  Now I need therapy because I have to adjust to the latest crap from Comcast.  When will it end?  Never!

Make sure if you have TV and internet you say both or they will try to only credit you for one. Told me $50 credit and then I said what about to and credit went up to $115. Hit them in the wallet. That's the ONLY way to get their attention for sick bad service

4360688960	2019-03-02T04:30:34	doodlebug4952	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I use Comcast for my job. There has been almost daily "area outage" for almost 4 weeks in Southaven, MS. We seriously need more choices besides Comcast and AT&T. My employer pays the bill (for crappy service that often keeps me from being able to work) otherwise I'd kick them to the curb.

So we either have to deal with slow as hell or interruptions all the time. Btw I got to the reps by entering bad info over and over on the automated system. I called 18009346489 today and did that.
4360716992	2019-03-02T05:16:14	disqus_5NlvW185T2	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Yep about 4 weeks for me too. At least twice a week or more. Im just going to start calling them to get credits every month like I mentioned in my other post till they stop screwing up.... So forever I guess. They have some formula to calculate credits based on how many outages they have on file for you. And it's number of days at least one occurred. Multiple outtages in a day is still only one day to them. But it'd be better to track it yourself. I got lucky with the girl I got connected to I think.

Current problems and outages	I know you're right, but like I said, employer pays for mine so that's not for me to do.  Heck, they won't even let me "register" the account # so I can get text updates on outages and such because they "own" the account.  If they're okay with paying full cost for this mess, that's on them.  What's hurting me is that when Comcast is down, I can't work ... period ... so greatly impacting my income.  I've looked into other options, just for my own info, very few available and they all have issues.  Sadly Comcast seems to be the best out of a bad lot with 3 out of 5 stars.

You have not done anything at all to better your company or your service to your customers after you've created a monopoly. I HIGHLY SUGGEST EVERYONE effected by their failure to provide paid services who do not get refunds to file a complaint with the BBB and the FTC. I hate this company.

Unfortunately, they won't be restoring any services by midnight..  The updated (& strangely precise) time for completion: EXACTLY "2:17am"..  Thanks for the specificity..i guess??  How about putting a little more of your effort toward fixing the problem; and a little less on whatever equation you use to come up with such an oddly specific (& most likely still SUPER innacurate) job completion time?

My phone gets better service than my laptop does.... my phone gets better service with the goddamn wifi off. How can my phone load up a website in seconds but my laptop takes several minutes sometimes and occasionally a pop up window stating, "connection lost", or "network down, please check your connections"....as if my connections just randomly disconnect for no reason at all.  Fuck you, Comcast. You rob every single customer you have and you hire complete idiots to answer your phones because goddamn it if you had to deal with the issues you cause or explain to one of your customers that you provide shit service that is waaay over priced and your a greedy fuck. Signing off, wishing you the same gratitude and loyalty you have given to the people that line your pockets. You steal time as well as money. Maybe even more time than money.  Comcast is like the plague, we all suffer from it and will probably die fighting it. Always , Danielle in VA

Act like the world owes you something. News flash world doesn't revolve around you. If you don't t like it go get some other crap service that will more then likely have the same issues every now and then. If you don't want to get another service shut the heck up. Dang..... Thank you Comcast for trying to resolve the service.

4375453825	2019-03-12T20:45:29	NatashaCog	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I'm REALLY getting tired of Comcast malfunctioning. The amount for service in Chicago is fairly sickening, but it would be a smidge less sickening if service could be counted on. Trying to control the remote is like battling satan! The screen freezes every few minutes and trying to watch DVR programs gives me a headache due to all the force I have to use on the stupid remote to make it register anything. Sometimes it will register buttons pushed several minutes ago right in the middle of your program...if you were fortunate enough to actually be able to watch anything in the first place.  The internet...wow, if it were any slower it wouldn't exist!

4376064867	2019-03-13T07:34:38	disqus_wveb37ZNH9	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I have been without home phone, internet and cable all day except for a half hour window this evening.  I am a SAHM for the moment with an infant and 2 daughters, one of which I am forced  to isolate since she picked up the extremely contagious and nasty bug going around.  We have the Triple Play package, no tv, no phone, no internet to stream music...so I had a lot of fun with a bedridden and extremely bored child who couldn’t focus enough to just read.  Sucked but we survived just fine.  Luckily.  Why luckily?  BECAUSE WE JUST BROUGHT OUR PHONES TO XFINITY MOBILE IN JANUARY AND THEY WERE PAPERWEIGHTS TODAY.   We have been loyal paying customers for well over 20 years.  I have never experienced a complete communication cutoff before today.  Our bill inexplicably increases significantly beyond the value of the package, service level plummets,  we were repeatedly and unapologetically gauged with OBSCENE data overages when there was a no strings attached unlimited plan available to us the entire time AT A LOWER RATE! I was spending hours on the phone trying to pinpoint the cause to stop the hemmoraging ($1000 we lost, minimum.  With a third baby coming) and customer service is usually (not always) excruciatingly painful.   After today you can guarantee that I will be changing at least one service carrier so I am never left with the awful feeling that I couldn’t even call for help from anyone because all our eggs are foolishly in one basket.  Lesson learned.

Even still, I could better understand and respect Comcast if they (1) communicated what the problem is, (2) provided general updates on progress being made to resolve the problem, and (3) ensure there is a credit applied to our bills for this outage.

Getting consistent ETA on resolution from Comcast is like next to impossible; right now services outage page says services will not be restored until 3.17.19...that just sounds ridiculous to me. Even still, I could better understand and respect Comcast if they (1) shared what the problem is, (2) provided general updates on progress being made to resolve the problem, and (3) make sure all customers get a sincere apology and receive credit for the outage. Just my 2 cents.

It is almost like this is planned just so they can keep getting free money from their customers while leaving them in wonders on why they have no service. They throttle your internet, they try to tell you that they aren't, and then want to charge you the same amount for a bill when you don't have internet. This company is becoming a scam now. A multi-million dollar company can not keep service going but yet a $60 phone company can give some great hotspot at any given time.

The average household uses less than 100GB per month. You must be doing something commercially to burn through that much data.

Current problems and outages	I have been having issues with internet access on my desktop, which is using an ethernet connection rather than wifi.  For some reason wifi and other desktops in the building work, but my desktop won't allow me to use the internet effectively.  I have been experiencing frequent disconnections from my services and tools that require internet connectivity, and I don't know if it is my device or the widespread outage I see reported.  The inconvenience would be mild if I wasn't afraid of this being a prolonged outage that could spread to my other devices.  I need internet for some very important communications and tasks this week and next, so I don't want to get stuck without the access I need.

4397168409	2019-03-26T21:03:12	citylady52	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	No On Demand service since at least Saturday March 23 in Ventnor New Jersey - thought it was just us - we live at 5000 Boardwalk  they drove us crazy with getting new boxes, sending out a tech - wasted our entire weekend - poor guy worked for two hours - found nothing wrong - at the end of all that - the person he phoned into said that there was a known issue with it...Really? Why didn't they tell us this first. Every time you call Comcast - you get someone else who gives you different info. They say that they are "writing notes" into your account but the next person can never find the notes. They really suck and their customer service is awful.The people are polite but no one knows anything and the voice prompts when you call in are nothing short of torture.  We later found out that two other people in the building (and probably many more who just aren't there now and haven't checked) do not have the service either as well as someone who lives nearby but not in the building.  One hand never knows what the other is doing. Last night we were told that unless enough people call in to complain about a specific problem they do not escalate it and do nothing to deal with it.

Looking for another service provider as I type this because Comcast obviously doesn't need our money. Poor service/business practices/customer service beyond anything I've ever encountered.

We JUST switched everything to Comcast: internet, home phone, mobile phone and cable. Our home phone hasn't worked since the Comcast guy first came out - almost 4 weeks ago. Those guys are absolutely clueless when it comes to home phones. Now - as of today - I can't send or receive texts on my mobile phone. They sold us the wrong phones to begin with, then they lost one of the phones when we returned them to the Xfinity store, but I'm the one out $1k. I just want to box up everything of theirs and throw it in the doorway of my local Xfinity and tell them we made a huge mistake. At this point, I'd pay whatever it takes to get the heck away from Xfinity.

I am unable to watch TLC online because I keep getting the message “Your subscription doesn’t cover this network”.  I’ve never had this problem before.  I’ve been able to watch TLC online for well over a year.  I called Comcast and I was told that the problem is with the TLC app. I notify TLC and they said that Comcast was referring all their customers to them for a problem that was not their fault.  Not happy at all.

Current problems and outages	Here's the problem Comcast service is available in Fayetteville Georgia, but something has changed in the DNS because I have internet on two other PCS in the house but not my Windows PC Windows 10 and Windows Defender troubleshoot indicates it's a DNS server is not connected to the internet so something at Comcast has eliminated some of our ISP some of our DNS IDs and not others it's a DNS problem. Comcast says they are aware of something in the area and they're making appointments to come out to people's houses to make Corrections this I do not understand. My PC of the three in our house lost internet connectivity at about 11 a.m. this morning Friday April 19th. However, I have Comcast service on the other two PCS in the house and there is nothing wrong with the PC that isn't making the DNS Server Connection.

4432465999	2019-04-21T18:01:44	glennisthemenace	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I am so sick of Comcast.  Every holiday and every time someone moves in or out of my condominium building, I lose service.  I would change providers, but, unfortunately, Comcast has us over a barrel -- our condominium is somehow tied into Comcast we do not have the option to select another carrier.  YES!!! I am angry.  I had a surgical procedure on Friday, and my doctor has ordered me to get plenty of rest and relaxation.  How can I rest and/or relax when I keep losing service every 45 minutes - 1 hour.  I had recorded the final round of the women's LPGA tournament in Hawaii and wanted to watch it yesterday but every 30-45 minutes, my screen would go blank and stay blank, and as soon as I tried to exit or change channels using my remote, the instant I pressed  Xfinity on my remote, I would get the usual message, "we are having difficulty connecting to the X1 platform. Please check your connections, etc., and try again later. I do all of the "usual" (power off, disconnect/reconnect cables, get back online, and within 30 minutes or so, screen goes blank again, and the cycle continues.  This went on all afternoon and evening yesterday and has reared its ugly head again today.  When I call Comcast, I get the usual -- Power off, tighten cables, etc. They then want to schedule a technian to come out (minimum of $50), which I decline because the last time I had a technician come out to my home, he did a "band-ade repair, and before he could even get to his next appointment, the problem I had called in about reappeared.  This is today's problem; tomorrow, it will be something new, but the process will be the same.  The frequency, however, is increasing and it has been increasing since the passage of "Net Neutrality".  Once again, the little guy gets screwed.  Unless you are one of Comcast's elite customers, your issues just get swept under the rug.      o

Who do I report you to for being a fucking day late on my service, you stupid bitch?

If everyone who is paying for Xfinity will get together and sue them for the days we are without service (it's called a class action suit, I think) then they will have to pay millions to their customers (although the lawyers would get the majority of it but at least Xfinity will be held accountable).

I was told by a Comcast tech years ago that the gain at the pole has to be adjusted every so often to prevent signal degradation. Apparently that's 100% true.

I mean we're paying you pretty big chunks of money and the service is just crap.. the people work very hard by the way, the company has been awful..

It was supposed to be fixed around 10:30 this evening, but they took the estimated time off. So, obviously there's a problem. I called and spoke to a representative, of course in the Philippines, and confirmed that they work around the clock. I've also received two credits today because I have spoken to two agents. The first agent told me that the only way you can get a credit is if you call them and speak to an agent. He said that all customers that are out of service cannot expect a credit and that the only way they can receive one is if they call and request it themselves. So far, I've been credited $18. Sure is inconvenient though, as my place is filled with a lot of smart home stuff and I can't use any of it. Getting a tad frustrated.

The first message said that it would be back on by 1 pm on Thursday.  The next one said “Don’t bother the call reps, they can’t fix it faster”.  REALLY???  An online chat last night said that it would be on in 1 hour... That outages were fixed by outside contractors and they had no say in how fast they worked.  WHAT???    First of all what kind of customer service is this “don’t bother the call reps”!!!   Second, if it is true that outside contractors handle outages, they are your representatives and you damn well have a right to tell them how fast to work.   My mother is an elderly woman who lives in this outage area. It has been raining for four days and she has been stuck in an apartment with no television.  I’m sure you’re going to expect the bill to be paid, but also expect me to call the BPU on Monday morning to complain about the outage and the service.  Common sense says that you should be apologizing to the effected customers and giving services or credit as reparation for the time lost.  Obviously your customer service department does not have common sense.

4453162556	2019-05-07T16:48:29	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	This post is quite long, but reading it might help you.  Service was on and off all day Saturday and Sunday. Come Monday, no service at all. Wifi name wouldn't even show up on the list. Since I'm an Xfinity customer, I used their public wifi to do my normal stuff. Now today, Tuesday, comes around and still no service. Called Comcast to try to get a resolution. Getting to customer service is a challenge all on its own. After explaining the situation to a few people and being transferred, finally someone got on to help. She was extremely nice and did everything she could possibly do. She ran some tests, confirmed that they were indeed experiencing an outage, and assured me that nothing on my end was wrong. With her help, my wifi name did reappear! That was all well and good, until it wouldn't connect. After she transferred me to someone in their "wifi department", this is where it got out of hand. The next woman I talked to was also very nice, but insisted that my all-in-one modem and router combo was the problem and it got nasty from there. I asked her, "How could it be on my end when everyone else online has been complaining about issues since Thursday?" I had been reading this thread since my issues on Saturday, so I knew what I was talking about it. Anyhow, she told me that it was not on their end and someone had to come out and replace it after  she said she ran more tests. Uh, no. I wasted enough time as it is. My response was, "Alright, fine, but someone has to come out TODAY." She checked their schedule and said earliest would be tomorrow, Wednesday, between 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. No. Absolutely not. "Then I have to cancel my service." I announced, "If no one can come today, cut my service." After bickering for five minutes, I eventually hung up. After I said I wanted my service cut and hung up, my wifi came back in full force. I don't think she ran the tests to begin with and started doing them while we were arguing. Moral of the story here is, I don't know how to summarize what I want to say and customer service races to start working for you when you tell them you're cutting your service. If you can get through to customer service, let them continue to run tests and do not buy the story they may tell you about needing a new modem and router.

However, he could not get near the power pole because of trees so close he couldn't use ladder.

I want my wifi installed please. I would think JCPLs forestry guy should do it. His cellphone is 609-613 -0632. He absolutely said that YOU should cut down trees inhibiting climbing pole .I think he is just a passive regressive, but talk to him? I am on Eastern Blvd, Bayville.

4455819237	2019-05-09T13:07:00	Naulzy	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Ever since I moved to Irwin, PA to take care of my grandmother (Alzheimer’s), I’ve been forced to switch to Comcast XFinity.  Before this, when I lived in California, we had DirecTV and the service was SO much more reliable.  XFinity goes out at LEAST once a month, and often goes out several times in the day that it cuts out.  It’s infuriating because my grandma relies on TV for her comfort and I repeatedly have to calm her down when the service cuts out because she starts paranoid thoughts like her bank account is empty and she starts crying thinking she’s broke.  Ugh!

I’ve NEVER had cable that goes out so often and takes so long to fix!  I would switch if I could, but my grandma has alzheimer’s (I take care of her) so she needs TV and Comcast is the only cable provider in the region (I read somewhere that cable companies negotiated these regions so they wouldn’t have to compete all over the world. Disgusting that the customer has to suffer!)

Constantly rebooting dvr and modem. Comcast tech out yesterday..changed connectors, ran new ground, installed new dvr.  Today same issues again. Another service call tomorrow morning. Based on complaints I have read they Comcast have an upstream problem that they do not want to acknowledge. I am sure the reboots and outages at each subscriber address is recorded so they know there is a big issue. Spending more than $2500 per year with this company and this is the service we get.  I am going to start withholding payment... maybe that will get some action. If they shut me off then back to uverse. I left them for similar issues. Maybe they got them fixed or at least reduced. This is all about the bejamins!!!!!

Both digital television are down from approx. 3:30 am Monday 'til late afternoon of the same day. Thanks to insomnia I am up too many nights. My television has been taken over by comcast 15 minutes or more every night, this has been going on for months. NO Answers/ no transparencies from Comcast. I was advised that this would happen every evening from here on out. The reason? The company needs to compile recorded data. I woke up on 5/20 to two downed digital tv's. Consequently, I phoned 2 different employees on the morning of 5/20, and went to the office concerning the loss of 2 digital tv times during early morning hours not to mention the disruption of tv every night for months.  Later on May 20 ( one tv was fixed on 5/20 ), we noticed that the bulk of our recorded tv shows had been deleted. We went from 80 % full to slightly over 0% empty. Very inconvenient. Loss of recordings - Very strange!  Maybe I upset someone. How?  I don't know!   Was I angry while talking to employees? Yes, thanks to a lack of answers.  Did I curse during my discussion? No!  Did I yell at anyone? No, not at any time! Seems as if Big Business has taken over!

Fucking 5 bucks. FIVE DOLLARS. SPENDING HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH INTERNET DOWN DOES NOT EQUATE TO 5 DOLLARS. If minimum is $12, they owe me a couple months of free internet.

Current problems and outages	For last several weeks, various codes on smart tv to reset box, call to have a system refresh at least every day for almost three weeks. Customer service is very nice to refresh each time but i feel like i talk to them more than i speak with my kin. When we do this, tv works as expected for half an hour then we go through the whole shut off, reset, refresh, phone calls etc. all over again. If it is working when we go to bed, it no longer works when we wake up. We changed routers early on and it worked for half a day. Most recent code is a new one rdk 0503. Not sure what is happening but feeling frustrated. We can only watch internet on the tv, no Xfinity.

Current problems and outages	No outages here, but the last time I checked my mail on May 23, 2019, all my old spam (which I had deleted ages ago) showed up in my inbox.  999+ of them, going back to 2015.  New emails are not coming through, except for a couple of spam emails.  And they go into my inbox.  Can't get in to any of my call records as Comcast says there's no phone number associated to do so.  Say what?  I was on the chat for 3 hours and 2 minutes and finally was told it had to do with outage #SI034920594 and I would be contacted when this problem was fixed.  Well, there was no outage in my neck of the woods as I was on the internet, on chat and also could use my phone.  I'm getting upset that no one has followed up on my problem.  I need to get my emails and look at call records, When I get I  click voice, I get  Sorry, but there's something wrong with your account. Error Code: No telephone number found on account. After 3 days, still no help from Comcast.  This is the first time in 4 years I've had a problem that hasn't been fixed immediately. This is inexcusable

Current problems and outages	Internet out all day in 84009, no one has addressed the problem as it’s been out all day. Awful communication for customers. We’re in 2019 not 2003 this is unacceptable, unfortunately our lives run on the internet and not addressing this problem properly is just ridiculous. Not only was there a late time frame but even after it still won’t work. Seriously? And now we don’t even have a time frame. Imagine all the businesses and people who work from home. I just cannot believe how ridiculous this is. 120% unacceptable. I hope you fail you POS. F U Comcast and your continuously shitty service. They’re lucky they don’t have competition. 2019 GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER

4498233531	2019-06-11T17:24:10	MarciM22	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	We have intermittent outage, either TV or internet down but never at the same time. Comcast send refresh and performs test. They state a tech needs to come out because we have "signal leakage". This was noticed weeks ago by a tech in the area!!!! The tech comes on Friday and says it is the power supply to our main box (secondary ones dont work unless the main on is up). Also our TV needs a new HDMI. Our TV is mounted on the wall, he scratches the wall, does not admit after questioning. Now he states it is not the power supply but the wall power outlet and it needs to be checked by an electrician. I ask how does either effect the cable modem (not in same outlet), he says it can. I told him to hold on and I can get volt meter and confirm it is not the outlet (DVD, TV and cable box work). In the mean time he bounces, as soon as I get back his van is already down the street. He did not even wait for the reboots. So now I am again leaving work 2 hours early so they can "fix" my service, oh btw is $190 per month.

Since he lives in Littleton, there isn’t a ton there that I am interested in. But he does have a PS4 there. And I’ve gotten pretty good at playing my favorite game, Overwatch. But Overwatch requires WIFI to play. And the WiFi went out this weekend, aka the weekend I am writing this. I have ADHD and anxiety, so I started get anxious about not be able to play the game (the game calms me down to say the least). There are only 3 games that my dad has that don’t require WiFi, but they are all kinda boring. I was looking forward to having a relaxing weekend with my dad, but because of this stupid WiFi issue, that isn’t going to happen.  So thank you for ruining the weekend I was looking forward to, REALLY APPRECIATE IT 🙄

4506621133	2019-06-18T13:04:46	leserlich	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Why am I paying for outages on all my services, cable internet phone. A few days ago I was told you can get a lousy 30.00.I had recorded programs. always pay on time and comcast should be giving us a break.#0.00 dollars was a slap in the face. My bill is over 250.00 a month. I had trouble yesterday with no tv or phone or internet. For over an hour. Then last night it started at 12.30 am.Why should I have to cancel my comcast acct when its a problem on your end. Also if your services aren't at least an hour they will give you no money back. That's every time it goes out not accumulated time.

Current problems and outages	We need a local (that's in each city) run internet service that's created like a utility. By the people in the area, networking together to offer good high speed connections. Give these A-hats a little competition. Need to start kickstarter or something like it to get it started. Each town, work to get their own IP set up. See how they like it when everyone leaves. It's the best way to take the smug smile off their faces. Affordable, reliable connections for the local people in each area. Find those with the skills and let's start putting the pressure on them.  😉

We had a power outage due to storm at 11pm yesterday that hit the entire neighborhood but the power came back on at 11am today. The internet, however, has been down since the power came back on. Id like to hope this is because the power at the service provider's place also went out but its obvious that not all of the places in Marion were affected by the outage. My relatives live in a neighborhood close to ours and their internet is just fine despite their power going out around the same time as ours. They have AT&T....

It damn sure would not hurt them & I am mot one to ask for anything free... It would be good Customer relationship or you guys can loose your LOYAL Customers & NO LONGER be the largest Cable provider... Hey the choice belongs to Comcast... Our service has been like this almost a month... NO ONE FROM COMCAST HAS ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE... Hey we still have a post office where you can mail flyers letting your LOYAL Customers know what is going on & how long it may last... Remember COMCAST IS THE LARGEST CABLE PROVIDER IN THE STATES... So I would think you guys should have some pretty smart IT personal... Evidently that is not the truth... If it was a day or two it would be much more understandable, but going on a month with NO KIND OF INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEM OR WHEN IT WILL BE FIXED... You guys ever heard of communication.???? Did Nasty Nancy Pelosi tell you guys not to say anything.??? Yeah I ain't happy paying for something I can't use...Hell maybe we need to send TRUMP to fix it... This remiends me of some crap CNN or MSNBC would do... No ideal what the problem is or how to fix it...

Download speeds are fine but upload speeds are reduced to 0.15Mbs. Spent an hour on the phone with them trying to blame my gear (as usual). We're using a Netgear C6250-100NAS integrated modem/router for our 60/6 service and it been running fine for the best part of a year. Yesterday the upload speed dropped off a cliff and I spent an hour with a Comcast 'Associate' with very limited English skills and no technical skills other than what her script told her to say. Still no solution and after much resetting was told to check back in  a couple of hours. Comcast is what you get when you allow Monopolies. Comcast and AT&T should be broken up like Ma Bell was. They're far too powerful and they don't have to give a shit about their customer.

Wasted another 90 minutes of my life on a "disservice" phone call to the Philippines.  I don't NEED to be advised to restart my modem or tighten the frickin' cables again!  As usual, CONcast claims there's no outage.  This is completely unacceptable.

Customers rely and pay for internet service to do their jobs. Most companies allow employees to do work from home and for the past month internet services have been impacting their ability to work at home using the exorbonate prices we pay for this service. Legal actions are bound to be forthcoming and reparations from Xfinity to their paying customers will be warranted! Unacceptable service and these issues will only negatively impact your brand as it should!  For the amount of money you generate surely there are highly experienced techs to solve this ongoing issue. Find them!!!

Current problems and outages	Comcast went out last night, called in anyway despite seeing that there were multiple regional outages reported in adjacent Vallejo zip codes... was fine all this morning then right when I have to do some serious shit for work, down it goes again! My modem can only bond a single channel upstream, which is not enough carrier signal to bring internet to the modem... meaning that the issue is Comcast but of course when anyone calls in they say that they’ll have to send a tech out for $90... this company employees nothing but the finest and most intelligent nincumpoops that the customer service industry has to offer.  Decided to actually look into the matter myself and there is in fact major regional outages.  Most likely some idiot doing roadwork put an awl through a bundle of fiber like every time... probably too expensive for Vallejo to properly mark utility lines as per usual.

Amazing, considering I've been using it for 20 odd years.

Oh, hey, network's still down, front end fresh meat fed to sharks still has no idea wtf is the problem, does teir 2, mayhaps, the golden tier 3 experts have a frickin explanation?

Can someone at my ISP, COMCAST.NET, explain to me why I can log into my webmail using the password that doesnt' work for this social media ripoff? Anyone want to wade in on this one? We haven't started on denial of service discussions, like .29 cent refunds for people who went so far as to complain about overcharges for businesss accounts. You're violating freedom of speech. From your customer. I'm not a tender snowflake, but you're ripping me off and preventing me from making it public. Allow to to explain is it in small words. My internet is down. I'm working off a laptop with a verizon aircard, and it's NOT Comcast, and it works almost flawlessley. Comcast customer support is worse than when I was doing dial up internet support, gotta love those "I sat in queue for an hour and got blind-dropped, cut off, etc.  Dear Comcast, please put me in the customer queue that is not impressed with your quality customer serviece, your customer service, or your cussedtomer service. You couldn't find your traceroute with an endless ping.  Thanks for sharing the outage with NOBODY in tier 1 helpdesk. Yeah, that was fun, as always.. "Hey, the network's down." "Did you unplug and plug it back in again?" "No, I looked online from a more realiable ISP ti find out your whole network is down, sorry your tier 2 didn't bother mentioning it,as that pwersn suffered, I also served my time behind the front line phones.

By 10am Mon they now changed it to 9:30pm mon night. Again, 9:30pm comes and nothing. So I call, they now then said tues by 9:30am. Guess what? Still no internet. New time estimate, 9:30pm tues night. What an absolute JOKE. Are there even workers there? I know it won’t be fixed by 9:30pm as I’m sure whatever non-working workers they hired are now going home (since it’s past 5pm). What massive joke. I’m honestly more livid that they don’t have the respect for their customers to just give an honest estimates.... I mean at least they gave a 4$ credit for the 3+ days without internet.

Everyday we’re told that the estimate will be restored by 9:30am, then when it doesn’t get fixed they push it to 9:30 pm and so on and so forth. This is a massive joke. That leaves me with absolutely no real idea of when it will ACTUALLY come back on. What a trash service. No respect for their customers and their customers time. Very disappointing.

After a month of consistent and daily interruptions with the service for all areas effected one would think that an honest response would be appropriate.  What Kind of issues? How the problem('s) are being addressed. Yes, just a little more informative transparency! Will you tell us all what the problem causing this is? Do you know?  Comcast has been pretty darn good with proactive and timely corrective action with service interruptions in the past.Provided with more information an understanding would be helpful for your customers peace of mind.  As it stands now we have no idea if Comcast has a  line on what is causing this and the customer is experiencing the same inconvenience for too long.   Please provide us all with what your expectations are and what ours should be? This is affecting business's and our clients. For us and others significantly!   Thank you.

4553578646	2019-07-25T20:34:35	donnageddesquinn	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Live in Camas, and we have many many outages almost every day and/night for at least the month or more.  It is more than infuriating!!!!!!  We have triple play so........no t.v., no internet, no phone!  Service was down when I went to bed last night, and was down this morning for 1+ hours.  Why haven’t these outages been addressed??  Not just us, many others in the area.  I would really hope that you give us a HUGE DISCOUNT ON OUR BILL(S)!,,  We pay TOO MUCH to have so many problems with your service.  And if you think that it is someone else’s blame (contruction, digging up and installing more lines) then you should seek reimbursement from them for causing so many disgruntled ustomers!

No offices and no one in support seems to know what is going on. Cable and internet have been out continuously for 7 days now.  One tech support operator advised that an outside provider is replacing an antenna...didn't know who the provider was, where the antenna was or how long it would take. Unfortunately Comcast is the only cable/internet provider available.  I hate satellite but outages during rain storms is looking better than Comcast's total outage.  You would think they would at least put out an e-mail to let people know whats going on, but that's not how Comcast does business. Their tagline is "Ready to Work". Apparently they are taking a vacation.

Current problems and outages	Let me start by saying this is my second time going into Comcast in a month because of the issues I have been having with my internet. The first time they clearly stated there is an outage in my area and has been for a few days , but “they are working on it “ Today when I went In I was pretty much called a lier! When I told this person I was here just a few weeks ago and they told me the same thing that you are telling me , the representative just argued and said oh no that couldn’t be true! REALLY ???  She then said the only thing I can do is give you a new modem ! Ahh.. and what the heck is a new modem going to do for me, and how do you expect me to install it, because according to costumer service , they will be happy to send someone out for a fee to install the new modem and check my lines!!!  They apparently have been getting multiple complaints because trying to get through was a nightmare! Will be switching as soon as I find a carrier that will get me out of this crap contract they put me in . Also just a warning for anybody that wants to sign up with them but does not want their credit ran.. don’t believe them ! I opted to just pay a down payment instead of having a new inquiry on my credit & as soon as I hung up the phone I see a notification from my credit detection they ran it! I was furious and nobody could tell me how they could have if I didn’t give them my SS # because I didn’t! The only explanation they had was it was because I was a previous costumer of cable many years ago ( until moving to dish) so that is how they obtained my SS# . That still does not give them the right to run my credit! If I didn’t have a business I would have canceled the minute they did that. I am now suffering from their incompetence and not able to send and receive a lot of my emails . This is a poor excuse of a company, why more people don’t just leave I do not know.

In the Portland, OR area pretty much every apartment complex only has Comcast running to their property.

None of that fixed the signal. It has to be what is being sent into my house. I am so tired of crappy service and it just keeps getting more expensive!

There used to be a device that you could attach to your cable to show outages. But the answer is always we do not say that service is up round the clock and we can not be expected to adjust one's bill since the prorated outage times are so few and little it would not be cost effective.

My Android Phone has zero issues connecting (and Android is Unix/Linux based). This isn't the first time... it happened a few months ago too and resolved itself. It's back (obviously) and is worse this time around. It does not matter if I connect to my wireless gateway, or any of the others in the building via the HotSpot. Again, my cellular phone seems to not be affected... just my four computers. Sometimes one or two will connect when the others won't, sometimes none of them will. New Castle, DE.

This has saved me a few times when I had to connect for work. Using now to try to check on status. Of course, customer service is a waste of time.  Their list of outages is laughable — most are resolved in a few minutes. They don’t list this one which has been on going for over 24 hours for some.  They won’t answer questions about when it will be fixed.

4582169430	2019-08-17T21:59:18	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	This is getting to be a bunch of BS. It's over a week of slow to no Internet connection. It's up, it's down. I can see the outage maps lit up like Christmas. But call Comcast and they'll tell you they're not having any issue's. I started 2 years ago with 400 mbps, after 8 months my speed was half or less of what I was getting and still is 2 years later. Comcast says they do not throttle back, that alot of people in my area must be using wi-fi. I know that slows it down, but to cut my speed by 50% or more, even in the middle of the night.... well, that's Comcast for ya!

That adds more fuel to the fire. I know, if they admit theres a problem, they have to start issuing credits. So they deny, deny, deny.

4587209598	2019-08-22T02:00:15	charlesbaserap	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Near DC, we lost it around 4:30, they said it would be fixed by 9:30, then as soon as that time came they said 1:30 AM. Every day it's at least an hour without complete service. They need to start prorating or having meters installed because it's the only way they'll ever be held accountable for the literal millions they're stealing from customers.  I'm ONE household. I estimated a few months back that they owed me at least $50 for all the outages and that's standard for a month on average Right now there's more than 3,000 in my area alone affected. Say even half those people have the same issues daily I have, that's $75k they're pocketing without providing full service. Why? Because most times they don't even notice unless you report it or even care. That needs to change.

4596873540	2019-08-29T21:01:28	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	The internet service is very intermittent the past couple weeks. The past two days it has dropped multiple times. Each time is when I was on a Skype call. The last one coincided with a telephone call coming in on my xFinity VOIP through my xFinity modem. My modem shows no errors and logs no errors. The drop outs are also happening within the same few hours 11:00 AM PDT to 2:00 PM PDT. I am also getting very slow connections late in the evening around 8:00PM PDT. Another issue is my wireless devices will loose connectivity with the modem, specifically IPhone and IPads. We must turn off the wireless on the personal device and turn it back on then Internet service is established again. No indication in the logs why the device is dropped from the wireless.

We have had no internet, tv (I don’t care about the tv portion) no phone service for the past twelve hours. I can live a day and more without internet but zero phone service in today’s world is unacceptable not to mention an archaic problem.   I had to go a nearby park, to reach comcast from the middle of a soccer field...only to hear the recording apologize for the outage, saying it’ll be fixed tomorrow morning. I certainly hope no one in the neighborhood needs to call out or be reached in emergency situations.  These companies operate at practically monopolies; They hold us in their grips woth ever higher costs. It is past time comcast step up it’s game and invest in infrastructure improvements and strive to make their customers happy!

Try changing to Google, it worked for me.  Primary 8.8.8.8 secondary 8.8.6.6.  If you're using a router change it in your internet settings, if you're direct connecting to the modem on your computer's settings.  Soon as I did that everything shot back up.

4597714065	2019-08-30T15:19:03	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I agree.  It now appears to be a DNS issue.  Outage began 8/29/2019 9:37am PST.  Partial service restored 8/30/2019 2:12am PST.  My router point to OpenDNS by default,so the Internet is up. However, reaching comcast.com, comcast.net, is down.  So for majority of people, they are still down if they don't know how to change their default router.  Checking various Comcast resources appears to also be down (if they're pointing to their Comcast DNS).

4597800396	2019-08-30T16:28:45	anthony_dicicco	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Literally every couple weeks Comcast/Xfinity service goes down. This is the worst product I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. If we are lucky the $250 a month allows us to watch TV for two and half weeks out of the month. The fact that they have a monopoly (if I'm not mistaken that in itself is illegal) in this area means they don't care at all about the product or customers and so we pay them an absorbent amount of money for an inferior product. There has been multiple techs out in a month of having their services and it's always no fault of theirs of course. It is the complex,t weather, or any number of reasons that they find to pass the buck.

We were first told it would be back on at 1:44, then 9:30 PM and then 9:46.  It is now 9:55 and still no service.  If it cannot be fixed at the time given then please do not outright tell your customers a lie. We have had no explanation for the outage and cannot talk to a human being.  This is unacceptable and a very poor way of offering good customer service.  I would appreciate if any problems in the future  arise you would have the courtesy to inform your customers of the type of problems that occur and more communication.  What happened to good customer service?  We have always paid our monthly bill on time and have been with Comcast for about 15 years so how about you treat us as a valued customer and keep us more informed.  Very dissatisfied with Comcast at this time. J

Each time I attempt to contact Comcast to report and find out the issue, I have to fight the ridiculous system. Each time I obtain a different person who recommends a different solutions. No one could tell me if a technician was working in my area. The only way I have been able to work my way up the chain until I get help is to be rude and uncooperative. Finally reached a supervisor who agreed to send a technician at no cost.  All morning I have had brief interruptions. At about 1:30 pm, I received a text a technician had resolved my problem, and I could cancel the technician appointment. At 3:00 pm, I had another 10+ minute interruption. When I called to report it, I was advised a technician was in my area and problems would be fixed by 6:00 pm.

If a company is going to be installing new lines towers w/e why not let your customers know!  I chose Comcast for the barely there data cap ability to link to any xfinity hotspot this allowed me to reduce my mother n my cell data and afford to get my grandmother a landline. (Single income, no assistance)  We stream all of our tv from Netflix or free channels... I’m so sick of their f/u customer service and what’s becoming extra  f/u service. I’m already frustrated due to their bs and have been looking for an out that won’t require a crazy deposit or leave a bill I can’t afford or risk damaging my fragile credit.  Before My grandmother passed away I asked to have the phone removed to reduce my bill.  Her dementia was so far along the phone hadn’t been used 1 time in 6 months... I was told I couldn’t, not until my bill was paid in full before the due date. My service was 100% active,  I didn’t have a problem with paying for the service up to the date I actually asked for the disconnection... unfortunately finances have me stuck in this pattern of paying not only for service I don’t use but now for service they aren’t providing.  I use to brag about Comcast now I hope nobody listened.  ***yeah, I know their is some extra venting in there

Current problems and outages	Comcast isn’t even a provider anymore, it’s just a business model at this point. They’ll screw everyone over just for money. Internet has been down for over 12 hours now and still no internet or any updates. So many people pay for Comcast and yet Comcast doesn’t give a fuck about us. If there were other options, I would pick every single option before Comcast, oh wait there is another option and it’s Sonic gigabyte internet. Piece out, you will never be missed, in fact I’m a be ecstatic after leaving your shit service.👎

Current problems and outages	UNREAL... over 1 1/2 hrs on phone.... outage... amazing that I can do everything else, BUT open anything with Xfinity. And with today's technology and how Xfinity stands above the rest, no notification of outage, just my extremely lengthy call with customer service.  Xfinity Wifi is working, able to search internet, social media, etc... can't open Xfinity account.   I bet the monthly bill will be the same OR this month there will be some sort of rate increase...  been a customer for over 23 yrs, beginning to have too many issues for the cost.  I guess with my "downtime" I will shop for another service.

Current problems and outages	Atlanta, GA - over 24 hours with speeds so low that my hardwired streaming services can't connect. Even wireless won't connect them.  When I can get on the internet via my computer, opening pages and closing pages take 10 to 30 seconds - even Comcast's own site!!!!  They are slow in whatever I'm trying to do on any page.  Trying to watch the news on computer and every few seconds there is fall out in picture and sound and it buffers over and over again.  Can someone tell me WHY this company that makes warship sized amounts of money has such horrible service?!  Also, ever notice that even when your service is out for days THEY NEVER GIVE YOU A REBATE OR CUT YOUR BILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All this trash in the air is screwing with xfinity wifi. The technical team at comcast are a bunch of idiots. It's a quick simple easy fix.  Edit: they dont even tell people that they set their private router to the default to broadcast a public hotspot. If more people knew this then they could simply turn their hotspots off themselves. It's not the peoples fault though.  Honestly, fuck comcast. Time to switch. Been with this company for too long.

Current problems and outages	The only thing worse than the internet outages I've read here is having internet that is running like dirt!  I'm talking upload and download speeds in the excessively low single digits!  Can't get webpages to load properly half the time and I'm lucky if even a video based site will let me watch anything.  Honestly I feel it being down would be an improvement.  What good is the internet I have if its basically worse than dial-up almost?

4669393087	2019-10-29T00:11:18	quentinteal	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	This is unacceptable customer service by Xfinity [a.k.a Comcast]. They tell you that they are aware of an outage, but you can't speak to anyone, nor do they give a timeframe on when the matter will be fixed. My service went out @ nine am on Sunday morning.  Instead it's a robocall voice indicating that the "Technicians" are diligently working to restore service. After reading some of your comments on here, I am wondering who is actually working on this issue. I bet, they wouldn't have a problem with their billing cycle printouts. I guess that is why they want payment in advance of each month. They need to stop deleting channels without permission or for every channel deleted; start lowering the bill. I have lost channels and my bill remains the same, now this nonsense!!!

Then to report the outage I got transferred to "outsourced in India", which might as well be a robot. They don't care, saying the problem can't be fixed until Saturday. It's Tuesday and I can't work from home untill next week?  Bad service on their part saying nothing they can do sooner because technicians from Washington are fixing a problem in California?  So does that mean the whole west coast is down? Stupid.  Now I have to drive to the Xfinity store in Fredrickson.  We have no other choice for cable or Internet in our area or we would use a different company. We have always been unhappy with Comcast throughout the years. But who is happy with them? Nobody.

It’s been a day, longer for other people. With the price people are paying for the service, you’d think Comcast would ATLEAST have stable service, but nope. I remember Comcast was a good company, but it has gone nowhere but downhill. I guess Money has changed their philosophy, over charging for shit quality. It’s 2019, almost 2020 and yet Comcast is by far the worst Internet provider ever! Sonic here I come. San Francisco 94112.

It is a national problem with all of comcast services. Their "servers" keep going down. I had to talk to engineering to get that info but engineering in the US. Their even having problems communicating with themselves. You know they have multiple back-up servers and it would never happen that all servers for US would be having problems at the same time but no problems outside of US. I am not a conspiracy theorist but it is interesting this would be happening on an election day effecting the entire Nation. By the way, the entire Nation is never out at the same time. The problem is roving. I tried on my phone to get news using xFinity Stream as they suggested. They told me all the streaming Apps are working...Not For Me!!!     Russia are you listening, I want my cable back...please!!!

The problems obviously still exist because I am still paying for blast speeds, but actually getting less to none. Help!

THEY MAKE A REPAIR ISSUE A NIGHTMARE ON PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU CAN CALL ONE DAY & report an issue.you will be on the phone one hour easy. They smokescreen you with bs &say ok we reset your modem. THEN THE NEXT DAY YOU CALL FOR THE SAME ISSUE; and there is not even a record that you phoned the day before. so now you begin all over again. mastec said most the time after 3 of these calls; most people will live with it. he then said; our government knows theyre crooked. he said they get fined 20 million here & 20 million there; & they pay it!   so basically they throw a “bone to the government a bone once in awhile

4703468419	2019-11-26T19:07:04	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	For the last two months there have been irritating, chronic issues with cable tv reception and they are getting worse. Comcast is living up predictively well as being the worst of the providers with respect to service. They do not even posses the courtesy to announce that they even have a problem and are working to correct it, let alone offer an billing adjustment while the  service fees still keep roling in to them. I intend to withhold payment for tv on my next bill. I also intend to  change providers after ten years of worsening service and notify both the corporate office this time as the regional office is equally non responsive.  This time I am going to also complain to the regulatory agencies  well. I am pleased to learn that the issue is pervasive and recommend the necessisity for all of us to act in a constructive manner in writing.

4714555694	2019-12-06T18:08:59	stoltze816	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Well I think that if you give them more and bigger tax breaks that service would improve dramatically. At least that's the argument they make.   Corporations; If we just had more of our profits to spend, we could upgrade and invest in our corporations infrastructure, that we currently gouge people over $200.00 a month for.  Consumer; But you've never taken any of the windfall from Republitards tax breaks and invested in your own corporations infrastructure, equipment, employee pay, you've only enriched yourselfs at the top and the voting shareholder. In fact the 15% tax cut that corporate America received, was t passed on to consumers, my bill didn't fall by 15%.  Corporations; Well our tax break aren't  designed to be passed on. That's not what the republican Congress wanted. They are simply in the pockets of corporations, see, consumer, since corporations are really people, and we have the juice to grease the palms of the greedy Republitard party, and buy power But the corporate tax break was never meant to enrich or help the working class. Here at Comcast we strive to gouge you as much as possible for crappy spotty service, that really isn't worth the $200.00 plus consumers pay us for our crappy service.
4714560346	2019-12-06T18:12:57	stoltze816	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Well as long as the Republitards keep rolling back regulations and giving corporations like Comcast huge tax breaks. Tax breaks that for most corporations, means paying NOTHING in taxes on their revenuers. It's also worth noting that corporate debt is now at 10 TRILLION dollars, which is several times more than in 2008. So who do you think is going to wind up holding the bag...AGAIN.....
4714574413	2019-12-06T18:24:38	stoltze816	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I do, and to me, that's not the purview of the tax payer. Those are upgrades to their core business. That's what Comcast charges us for. Two decades ago, corporations took part of their profits and upgraded their business, bought new equipment, paid employees more etc. Because corporate CEOs were paid based on the performance of the corporation, not just the value of the stock, which is now how CEOs are paid.   I've attached a report done by a well known economist and he points out how stock buy backs are at the heart of corporations so called  financial success, which is based on the artificial value of their stock. As they buy back their own stock it drives the price of their stock up, because less shares are available on the open market.   This report is easy to read, easy to digest without needing a college degree. It's a short read but very informative. And you really get the idea that the Republitards under Regan knew what they were doing when they pushed for the roll back of the regulation that prohibited corporations from buying back their own stock. One reason is because it allows insider trading to happen.   https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gsOzf3oAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26user%3DgsOzf3oAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DgsOzf3oAAAAJ%3Aruyezt5ZtCIC
4714603202	2019-12-06T18:48:30	stoltze816	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	In zip code 98052 Redmond Washington, I've had a compete blackout since 1:30am this morning. When I called I got a recording that said due to maintenance we were expecting an "interruption". But they would call me as soon as my service was back online, like I would need them to call me to inform me that my service has been restored.   What I want is he truth, it's not maintenance, since all Xfinity hot spots aren't visible like they were yesterday.  So I can't connect to a hot spot and at least log onto the web, and stream some TV for my elderly patient.  Comcast gouges me over 200.00 bucks a month, and this is what I get. One more reason they don't need a tax break, since it doesn't benefit the consumers.

I am in the 61455 Area and our business internet at 75 MPBS Down 15 UP is less than 85 per month.  IF you are paying that much money, maybe you ought to be looking at why?  Do you have Television when you could be streaming instead?  Do you have home phone, that you never use?  Do you have a ridiculous amount of bandwidth you are paying for that you could downgrade and save money?  Chances are you are paying too much because you told them this is what you want and this is what you need, and you were probably wrong.    PS.  I know you liberal dumb asses want everything for free or cheap, but comcast has spent HUNDREDS of millions in infrastructure upgrades of their OWN profits and government money.  You cannot however fix and angry stupd libtard.

I called Comcast and their recording indicated their system was down and was expected to be restored by 10;40 pm. It was still down after midnight and realized their estimate in restoring service was wrong. I have been with cable tv service back when Selkirk TV started it and now Comcast has had repeated disruption of service without any compensation to their customers, but continues to increase their rates.

I've been a cable tv customer since Selkirk started this service last century and throughout the various cable tv companies, Comcast has had the most disruption of tv service of all the others combined and their corporate offices in Philadelphia, Pa seems not to care on the poor quality of service the south Florida customers receive.

Current problems and outages	My internet connectivity has been down intermittently tonight for some reason.  Last time this happened many months back, I called and after some investigation and discussion, they finally admitted that some 3rd party company that they use for their modem/router combo devices was probably forcing an update on their customers (one we did not authorize), which causes the device to reboot (and these devices take quite a while to reboot and seem to cause the connectivity to go on and off during that process.  Note that it also can disable the phone, which is very dangerous if there is an emergency).  When I asked how to disable or at least configure these unwanted and poorly-timed automatic updates (sometimes I am awake late at night so it is incorrect to assume that everyone wants them at that time), they said there was no way to do so and admitted that they really had very little in the way of communication with whatever company forces these updates on us.  I find this entirely unacceptable as a customer.  All updates in any device should be 1: ALWAYS be only optionally automatic, 2: When not automatic, done only when the customer is ready to do so, not suddenly and mysteriously interrupt our connectivity, 3 - If there's some 3rd party company doing something to the modem/router they are renting out to us, I expect them to have far better communication with them so they can provide proper support to their customers about such issues.  I made this crystal clear when this happened before, but perhaps posting on separate sites such as this one will add a bit more emphasis.  That said, their customer support has been quite polite and reasonable with me almost every time I've called over many years regarding various issues, so I do very much appreciate that.  But this would seem to be some kind of high-level management issue.  Comcast is not cheap, so I absolutely expect them to meet reasonable standards such as proper customer control over updates.  This needs to be fixed, particularly if it is as I suspect once again the cause of the connectivity problems tonight.  (As an aside, this also applies to ALL companies that are guity of this, including Apple cell phone, Sony streaming players, etc.).

4728213231	2019-12-18T05:25:20	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	All you complaining!! This is what you do. Go to Boost Mobile get a modem for 35$ and no contract Xfinity wifi for 45$ u can pause the service, if there is an outage thy give u extra days of service. I am with Boost Mobile so if you pay your bill at Boost Mobile location Boost covers $5 so you pay 40 a mounth plus u can add on tv service for 25$ or just go with with the free streaming apps. Speed is about 28MBps and it's enough to stream HD my Xbox and 4 phones no problem. Best think NO CONTRACT!! Also u have option to pay for a week a day or a month (mounth being the cheepest (week is like 12.99) and I had this service for 2 years now and thy came a week ago to ungrade my old line that was going from the pole to my house and thy put a new one inn free. I usually get 34 days out out of my service but that's becouse if your internet is down for more then 30 min call them tell them it went down when u went to work and now u back and calling to fix the issue (just reset your modem when u leave for work so thy know u tried to fix it and thy will credit you even thou it was not broken) I just love it.
4728225107	2019-12-18T05:49:46	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Yes Thay do that. Get over it  just like you can't stop windows from downloading an update and installing the company's do it without your knowledge but it's all explained in that 100 page terms and condition essay who nobody reads and just clicks yes I agree. My suggestion is get the NO CONTRACT Xfinity modem for 35$ plus tax and it's $45 a mounth and if you have Boost Mobile as your phone provider you will get 5$ each month. I am from Chicago and hear you can get it at Boost Mobile stores. Service is fast and worth the $45/$40 a mounth. You can pause your service of you going out of town and if you get an outage they will reimburse you for the days you did not have service also if your internet is not back up in 30min to 1 h Thay will extend your service by 1 day. Technicians come out also the very next day if you are home or same day if you call in morning. I had the service for 3 years I get about 28MBps witch is sufficient enough to play my Xbox stream in HD and support 4 phones at the same time. Technically I can hook up 20 devices not too shabby for $45/$40 and for $25 more u can add tv service l. Again NO CONTRACT I highly recommend this option!!

But you have to call the be nice and you will save some. $$$$$$

4729430504	2019-12-19T05:53:28	anthony_dicicco	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Garbage. This companies products (ridiculously high costs), customer service, and ability to remedy these issues are the poorest of any major company my family deals with. I thought AT&T was bad! They are the greatest company ever compared to Comcast/Xfinity. To make things worse, they have the area I love in under a monopoly (still illegal in US I thought?) so they do not even attempt to make things right when something goes wrong or even act like they give a shit. This was our last straw. My wife and I are cutting the cord. Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc, etc... I was told that if the internet doesn't work then cable doesn't work and unfortunately for them my youngest brother is in home automation in Texas. I spoke with him and that is an outright lie. So... Goodbye and good riddance. They may be the only cable provider but they are not the only internet provider.

4729490921	2019-12-19T08:07:36	disqus_WCaNFc8KvF	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Kamil Kuta: First of all, thanks for the info, I do appreciate it.  As for "get over it" I do have to politely disagree with that: if more people were more vocal when businesses have glaring flaws in their products and services, they wouldn't get away with it so often.  And as for Windows, actually that's probably not the best example since I'm a software engineer who works primarily on Windows and DO have it set up so I have complete control over when updates are applied. Yes, what you said is the default, but you can get around it unlike Comcast's rental modem.  My tech background is a large part of the reason why I'm so particularly angry and vocal when tech is designed so very incorrectly, which it all too often is these days.  ALL tech should be designed to particular standards (such as full control over updates), and I will never accept any product as a decent product when it falls short of those standards.  No one should.  But too many people do which is why these companies get away with it.

Comcast simply gives the usual reply - they say that their  signal is good and that the trouble must be with our equipment but they will come and check it out for $70 !!  So what - they show up when the internet happens to be working and say everything is just fine - you  owe us $70.

4743028011	2020-01-03T01:46:16	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I'm sick & tired of constantly getting up from my chair numerous times a month, stooping down to pull the cable box out from it's shelf to unplug it so that it can reset itself.  For my $200 monthly payment to Comcast, they certainly should have better service than this!  Their "customer service" is comparable to living in a third world county!!!  I'm a 70 year old senior citizen with bone-on-bone arthritic knees who is strongly opposed to getting her knees cut off.  So this very major issue of mine is, as far as Comcast is concerned, not worth their time.  Why should I be expected to rearrange & reorganize my entertainment system plus grin & bear pain due to my numerous excursions to reset a box that they want me to turn in for another.  NO!!!!  I will lose all of my DVR programs that "they" can't replace due to their lack of past technology utilization & the inability to think beyond the big plan that would benefit their customers. That, combined with the fact that the boxes are made in China. C'mon now, we all know China's manufacturing is one of the major downfalls of our country's economy.  Most of what they mass produce is junk.  It just doesn't last!  Comcast penny pinches with their products & even goes further in pilfering funds from us to pay for the ridiculously increasing charges of their notorious Regional Sports fee & Broadcast TV fee. That issue has become so bad that customers have even filed lawsuits against Comcast citing that they are simply using these fees to raise consumer prices to avoid charging higher monthly plan rates. It's clearly a bait & switch ploy.  Comcast already has rights to several of the channels they claim these fees pay for so why are they consistently raising our fees to pay for what they already own? (refer to NBCUniversal's $64 TRILLION paid by Comcast and a buyout of China's (again, China!) Universal China theme park for $6.2 TRILLION).  Plus Comcast has now grouped the beloved Turner Classic Movies channel in with the Sports premium plan for $9.99 a month. IF the consumer wishes to continue watching TCM, they are forced to pay the $9.99 charge!. The unmitigated gall of Comcast!  TCM IS NOT & NEVER HAS BEEN A PREMIUM CHANNEL!  NOR IS IT SPORT RELATED!  But the customers cannot get any answers from Comcast as to why they have done this.  We know the real answer is to filch more funds from the ignorant customers (us!).  Will this blatant conglomerate of capitalist thieves never stop?!!!  WHO IS COMCAST KIDDING??!!!  I'm sure that neither the Maryland Attorney General, the FTC and the BBB would consider TCM a PREMIUM SPORT CHANNEL.

Current problems and outages	Crazy how I can see there's clearly an Outage going on in my area, yet when I called and spoke with a Comcast technician they stated to me that; We do not see any issues on our end, however offered to send a tech out tomorrow,   Which is odd because they usually fight tooth and nail to not send someone out if they really don't think its their fault or issue, and why would they if their not at fault there's nothing they can do if it wasn't right?     So I guess the point of me posting this is pretty much just adding to the conspiracy that ISP Providers are shady liars that take no responsibility for their own faults.

Current problems and outages	Internet down once again (Arlington VA, 22205), during the best part of my show...cant forget to mention the bill increase over the last 2 months (that's right, twice - zero explanation from the goons at Comcast). Expecting people to pay more while providing a failing service - at least hold up your end of the bargain. Its great that in America you have a choice, but unfortunately despite that fact, many folks do not have a choice regarding their ISP - but fortunately for me, I do have a choice, & I will be leveraging that choice to switch providers next month if your service & untransparent billing issues are not addressed.

ANY REASON TO RAISE THE PRICE.....In late Dec., 2019, i received a notice from Comcast advising of an upcoming adjustment upward to begin Feb. 1, 2020......Equipment and svce increase by 1.00......Taxes, services and fees increases by 2.00...That's only a couple weeks away, so what else will be tacked on b/4 them......My monthly bill will then be hitting 90.00 monthly......for....monthly BASIC CABLE....MY DECISION;  PAY THE STUPID 110.00 CANCELLATION FEE.....THEN CANCEL COMCAST/XFINITY PERMANENTLY.......I'M GOIN WITH ROKU !

Update at 1:10 p.m. ET:  I've been doing direct messaging with Xfinity in twitter, this is my latest reply:  "The higher tier team is working on the ticket currently. No Comcast was not breached like with all technology sometimes apps and programs run into internal code issues. Our awesome higher tier team is working on the issue for you. -Tom" I still have no access to my xfinity account, email or phone app.

I asked them what the hell was going on. They told me the cable had been cut by what i believe to be Gresham utilities or something like that. So much for precise engineering!!!! Freaking idiots. And XFINITY? Not much better. I called on my cell phone. They had a recorded explanation that basically said they were having problems (DUH) and every time I called...the hour of fix went up by one until the fix time went from 3pm to 10pm. I finally went to bed. The problem with XFINITY is they really have no competition especially in areas like where se live. That has to change because if I had options on any similar quality...Id' sign up today!

The recent weeks the picture quality has degraded to the point it’s hard to watch and it shows up on our recordings also. It’s as though the picture is being scrambled mainly on the faces of characters. For the price of this service I expect the best quality “wishful thinking” of everything from our TV - Phone and internet. Is Xfinity getting ready for the Super Bowl Sunday February 2nd or I don’t watch anyways?  Thank You  P.S. Now our remotes will only turn our picture off even after replacing all their batteries and now stuck with not even a pay channel to kind of watch. Thank You from my dog Cooper “WOOF WOOF BARK BARK WOOF

It takes the phone out too.  And they wondered why I wouldn't buy cell service from them.  This is one of many reasons comcast is often rated as one of the worst companies in the nation.  I can't figure out, for the life of me, why the upcoming schedules for TV lose their memory after an interruption lasting a second or less.  It takes more than 24 hours to get the full grid up and running. Maybe we should ask the Russians to fix it.

4794931025	2020-02-13T18:29:11	disqus_wGO5ZP3OKX	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	My business internet has been down today, again. Its a daily thing and has been going on for the last few MONTHS. The equipment is all up to date and running strong. I've had several customer service reps tell me that this area has daily outages, multiple times a day. Some are 5 minutes, while some are 2 or 3 hours if not more. If I shut down my business multiple times a day without warning for sometimes hours at a time, I wouldnt stay in business very long. I am going to call my accounts manager today and see if we can change service providers. Losing service EVERYDAY is absolutely insane!  Everytime the internet goes down, it cost me customers. Obviously none of the money we're paying goes to improving the system. I don't know of any business that could survive with this caliber of performance.

Current problems and outages	total service out on the 1700 block of 5th street, but this is due to the actual comcast tech,s that was outside my home around 3 o'clock today up on the pole , as there was 5 of watching 2 comcast guys up on the pole in there trucks, couldn't understand what the issue was cause the service was fine ,everything working ,then all of a sudden its totally out , so we figure it be out for a moment so comcast got down in there trucks and left, just like that, left our service off .in all of a matter of 2 mins, we call them an the comcast operators are real shitty, as if its our fault , we already done all the trouble shooting that's common with them, but as fast as they turn it off , which was no cause or fault of ours they make you feel as it is an tells us its going to take a whole day to have a technician to come out to look at the issue, Haa, Please!!!, We all know what the issue is, its them not knowing what the hell there doing , if I work an did the crap they pull today , I would of been fired for my non professionalism in that field, seriously , its not like comcast cant have the technician to turn around an fix what he fuck up so easily in the first place, it wasn't broken or out in the first place so why fix it right? So conclusion is now is comcast going to compensate for there mess up, an #2 I hate how they pretend they cant hear you an your phone is fading in an out , they don't like to hear the truth or be in the wrong but wont fix what we pay for, is this any way fair , I feel we pay comcast to be shut off an put off for a whole day just to turn it back on, Now I am calling the BBB to make this a point of what happen an how they are treating it an customers, an also I,m calling there main office to report the comcast desk people ,there so phony an rude an don't want to get on a real problem when one exist, but jump to nothing when there isn't one, Now does that make sense , Not at all …..I'm loosing money not being able to work thru the internet , will I get compensated for my lost for there mistake??? we'll see...
4795390518	2020-02-14T00:59:27	disqus_oauyFSbcAs	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Comcast TV in my area in the eastern metro Pittsburgh PA area has been problematic for at least 3 hours beginning around 5:00 PM EST.  First, my remote would not work to control anything but volume -- would not even turn the service off for several minutes.  At one point I got a window that said that Comcast was having trouble connecting to the internet and I should check my connections.  I did and they were fine.    I put fresh batteries in the remote and it made no difference.  Then it began working somewhat -- if I pushed button for the "guide" nothing happened or it would pop up the channel list on a delay of as much as 30 seconds but then I could not scroll nor exit out of it.  Then everything seemed to be working, but still on a lag.  Then the picture became darkened at the top edge of the screen for a while, then the channel banner appeared across the bottom and would not go away -- eventually the screen became dark and only the channel banner appeared though the sound was still on  .  Now, at 7:50 the picture is back but I still get nothing if I try to open the "guide" or change the channel.  Very frustrating.

Haven't had service since Thursday and won't have tech available until next week. What a joke for the largest cable co. That's why they have closed all their offices in the Lady Lake, Ocala and Leesburg, Fl areas because they don't have any reliable service. Thanks for robbing us blind and not providing not only good service, but no service at all.

I just noticed last night When I got home that my WiFi couldn’t load anything, & the router says there’s internet. My house is right in the center of a cellular dead spot in the valley. I restarted the router multiple times, With no change, yesterday & today. Luckily the security system is still connected to century link. so, there’s something, but it runs so slow I can barely get onto websites. My centurylink is getting 124ping, and I’m getting .94mbps Download on that Rn too. Is there anything that can carry a decently large load and is good & reliable in SLC,UT

Also definitely do the CHAT with Xfinity and demand a credit for this month.  They'll throw you $10 not sure if you can escalate and get more.         The only other time it's been out like this is when a car wreck took out a station a few years ago.  This was not cool, Xfinity and I had to pay $75 in data overages with my cell provider this weekend to work.   All the Xfinity hotspots were out too obviously.

4809155222	2020-02-25T15:08:38	Maggietish	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Comcast cable TV outage started at 6 AM on Thursday, 2/20/20. Was told by the place that I’m renting that the service would be out until today. No explanation given by Comcast for this 4 day plus outage.  It’s 10 AM and they’re is still no cable TV working. This is an outrage.  Good time for people to consider other cable networks Who respect their customers enough to give them Quick service and viable explanations as to what happened and why Comcast is taking so long to repair it. Comcast policies have always been after 24 hours people get refunds. That was applicable to both Pennsylvania and New Jersey and I’m assuming that’s nationwide policy.

So how much longer are the customers supposed to wait before Comcast gets around to fixing this?  One can understand having a problem but  the lack of communication is not a good business move and is lousy customer service.  This is a wake up call for cable and Internet and phone customers to check out of the companies and see what they have to offer because we’re certainly not getting anything from Comcast except the monthly bill

When I see the cabling in the streets here in PCB it reminds me of a 3rd world country. No wonder there are always problems. It feels like Comcast is enjoying profit, but not investing in new equipment. New management would help I guess.  In Michigan the network is quite stable though. Why not here in PCB?  I used the Xfinity chat support yesterday. Useless. They are telling me after a long time that there is a problem with internet. What a great information! I am trying to work here. Comcast is not fulfilling it’s contract. I am aguest here in PCB, but account holders should stop payment to Comcast.

4823228580	2020-03-06T20:36:20	Maggietish	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	What is it with Xfinity/Comcast. They just had over a five day outage two weeks ago for the Cable TV and I believe the Internet was also involved. Here we go again cable TV is out in Claremont. Where I’m renting they said they were told by the Comcast people they’re going to send a technician out hopefully that’s today and not three weeks from now. It’s now 3:30 p.m. and no one has seen the technician yet.   This company has no sense of urgency or customer service. When I find my permanent home they will not be the cable company that I will select by any means. Question: how many people were refunded money on the last outage because their policy is if you don’t have service for 24 hours then they will refund you.

Don't feel sorry or thankful to them, ISPs are notorious for not building out enough infrastructure to meet the demands if all this customer are utilizing the service, they do this to booster profits.  They also lie about the bandwidth they provide, since that number is really just an abstract calculation of bandwidth, not a real value based on local metrics.

They knew this problem was coming and did nothing to prepare for it. I didn't think they would though. This is comcast for you.

Current problems and outages	Comcast is a piece of shit on the phone from 9 am until 8 trying to tell them there equipment is not working and there boxes are not working and finally with arguing they said the boxes are showing off line well no duh. They said there was a outage in my area nope all the neighbors are fine asked them. Than tried to tell me the outage was 2 counties away from me which is a hour away. if I'm the only one having the issues and now at 8 pm you figure this out now your schudule someone to come out at 8 am the next day. When they could have had a tech out from 1 to 3 the same day but again the supervisor was in another country and was to dumb to figure it out to put a ticket in 7 reps later I finally get a rep to come out next day now a service I pay in full not late. 3 different boxs 3 different rooms are not working but the tv and other things in those outlets work. My internet works and my phone the cable boxes dont work makes no sense. When this virus is over switch services they are the worse service to have.

4866992886	2020-04-09T02:04:34	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	An excavator boom snagged an arial fiber optic line on the east frontage road across from Tomah Rd @ I-25. There are multiple repair crews on site and a lane will have to be shut down to do the repair. As of 7:00 pm, they were waiting on sign crews out of Northglenn for the lane closure. Since additional service will likely have to be cut to make the repair and permission given for that, it will probably be 1-3 am before they can start the repair. I would venture a guess of “restored” by morning but that’s all I’ve got. I’m not very happy about it either. Dead in the water with no internet.

Current problems and outages	Last 24 hours internet download speed between 1 (!) and 20, which is between 1% and 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Called Comcast, who said they're no problems in my area, and after running remote "tests" and re-setting my modem, suggested the problem was that my modem is two years old. Clearly, the problem is lack of bandwidth for the pandemic surge in traffic. They must know this and hopefully are taking steps to address the problem.

Current problems and outages	Bloomington, MN - Intermittent bandwidth drops every ~3-6 hours, with each drop lasting up to an hour. I don’t know what’s worse: having to swap over to cellular, or having to roll over while Comcast finishes all over us like this.  This service is abominable for what they charge.  Should pressure them with more customer complaints to Comcast’s phone support asking <i>why</i> the service is experiencing an outage. No hand waving allowed.

Customer service doesn't know how to solve the issue. You can barley understand the rep. They have you repeat steps over and over.

I get a bill for 200 overage usage but how when its unlimited. They said i had 250 mbps which is 133 a month but if unlimited 1000 mbps is 133 why am i being over charged 200? Been without service for 24 hours. Made an appointment but then get a text saying the issie was resolves cancel. Lol. My internet still is off. Wow att is looking like they may have a new customer.

Current problems and outages	In Seattle, I am paying for 75mB DOWN AND 25 uP SERVICE AND BARELY GETTING 6 DOWN AND 1.5 UP!  This is crap!  And its been this way for months.  They can't BS their way of saying the area is under heavy unplanned usage (due to stay at home).  They are throttling the services!  All in an attempt to  sale bigger packages!  Where is the consumer  protection?   Like any utility, they should be required to expose all of their data.  This is corporate welfare by ensuring they have a monopoly and guaranteeing they make a profit.   Why not have the PUC change the billing practice to have us pay for what we use?  Not a BS package that states something like average up/download speeds when most of us never get that!  And BTW, average means I should be getting higher speeds which I never have seen. If we paid for what we used, they would be forced to improve their deliver and as well as be proactive and engaged to make sure everyone is getting what they need (and willing to pay).    !!!

4908066559	2020-05-10T05:23:07	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	hi ali, the simple answer is no and yes. No restart (either via the website, app, plug/unplugg or even factory default) will work, i tried them all and been having problems as well. The fact is, comcast is notorious for "throttling down" internet speeds to keep the network going. That means that you probably have half the speed (or less) and will be subjected to interruption in streaming services and/or gaming. They cannot handle the weekend quarantine traffic (especially with how cold it is, more people are using it than ever this particular weekend.). Your best bet is to turn on/off your connection to your modem/wifi (via airplane mode or just disconnecting and reconnecting) instead of flat our restarting the modem. Sometimes it happens to me, the connection is lost but it doesn't re-connect, so i manually connect/reconnect and boom its back. There is no need to restart your router as it is not the problem (and takes forever).
4908069206	2020-05-10T05:28:38	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Yes indeed, I do not live in your area, but my area has been pretty stable for living right in the heart of Baltimore until the quarantine happened. On weekends its like the network can't handle it (especially this weekend with the cold front). Too many people online at the same time, on top of that,  they make upgrades to the system and they ironically need to lower their capacity as they power down individual sectors/units to increase the overall capacity. That's why one day your internet is good, then bad and them BOOM greater than ever, then ok/good again and the cycle continues blah blah blah (sadly with comcast it never lasts lol)
4908072445	2020-05-10T05:35:32	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	(Baltimore) Internet is up but spotty. Some pages lag a bit, and streaming sometimes faulty (freezes then returns, aka lag). For gamers it's pretty obvious, especially if the game disconnects you once it detects no connection (freeze), you can also notice it in pages, you may click on a link and kind of freezes up for a bit or images/ads/etc that normally load real fast just freeze up for a second or two.  Also pretty much everyone I know here in Baltimore reports this happening after 7pm and on the weekends, they are literary rationing the internet capacity. Comcast always sucks, but this is due to the quarantine for sure based on the days/hours it happens specifically.
4908077517	2020-05-10T05:46:44	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I know pauline! it is almost criminal and surely shameful. On top of that check this out: when i moved into this apartment, the landlady reported an issue and they never fixed it, it just got fixed like 5 days later to the general public, BUT they did manage to trick that poor sweet landlady into buying a new "packaged deal" that would set her back 350 dollars a year (all she has is rent, and social security). She got lucky I detected their shennanigans and put them in their place, but they would have probably gotten away with it, they are literary robbing old people, the disabled, and well the "technological illiterate" crowd, shame on them, millions on executive bonuses (which they dont deserve)  and they can't keep a damn network stable.
4908079423	2020-05-10T05:51:00	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	true it is due to the quarantine. Cable internet has always been known for "clogging" up and even though they have made advances as the years go by, it can't handle the quarantine traffic (especially on weekends and late evening/nights). It's not just comcast, but im pretty sure most people suffering have a cable provider (its affecting DSL too, but not as much)
4908081967	2020-05-10T05:56:31	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	You want to see frustrating? google their executives pay bonuses. Bonuses for messing up what when you it add up, is similar to the amount of money needed to fix their damn infrastructure. Also they love to prey on old people, the disabled and "mentallly challenged", and of course plain normal people than don't have a tech background with confusing packages, security upgrades (which dont really do much and cost way too much) etc etc and horrible contracts. Monopoly is bad for everyone except a couple of executives and several shareholders.
4908083829	2020-05-10T06:00:40	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Good luck. Comcast is a monopoly, it's one of the reasons they don't care, they literary don't care and yes they do have the money and manpower/resources to fix it all. They rather give that to their executives (as bonuses),  bribes (through lobbying in D.C/congress) and marketing. Since they have a monopoly, they don't care about customer service, because they know the alternatives either cost too much, or it's like 1999 internet speeds lol.
4908085066	2020-05-10T06:03:35	frankcaban	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	It's the quarantine, they can't handle the traffic. They could have avoided it with ironically the same amount of money they used to pay their "executive bonuses" (for what? for f'ing up lol) but nope it's comcast, its a monopoly and they dont care, they do the bare minimum despite making billions.

I would NEVER recommend COMCAST/XFINITY to anyone.  Their cheap REMOTE doesn't even have a light so often times i use a flashlight to see the options.  Why not just give their customers a decent rate and stop the bullshit.  They want us to call and complain so they can give us a couple bucks off and land another contract....I'm done with COMCAST/XFINITY..........FOREVER !!!

Honestly only reason I have xfinity is because they luckily don’t have strong competition around this area for the service I need. If there was another option for a decent price, I’d change my service in a heart beat. I’ve had 80% negative customer service interactions and now regular service is lacking. We need more real competitors now. It seems there’s nothing motivating the company to provide high quality service for the high prices they charge.

Current problems and outages	Comcast and it's crappy business internet service is going to get both myself and my daughter fired from our jobs!  We are in Folsom, CA and work for 2 different companies.  Both employers IT departments are indicating no issue within the company. Of course it's impossible to actually speak to a live person EVER!  When the idiotic robotic and physical modem restarts don't correct the problems, you wait 2 days for a technician to come out.  Technician walks in minutes before 5pm, has a hand-held device that indicates no problem at that precise minute and informs us that he will bring the intermittent service issues and continually dropped IP telephone calls up in his group meeting the next day!!!   WTH?  Comcast doesn't care, as they have businesses locked into contracts.

I get fucked out of $80 every month for a shity internet service that is presently down for "maintenance" here's an idea concast, instead of giving literally everyone unlimited internet by pushing a button and raping people's wallets of those who actually pay for unlimited internet why not just make it to where everything is a cheap cheap af price, high speeds and unlimited and call it done? this stupid Xfi advantage bulshit you push is all obviously just bullshit and not needed because if someone down the street only pays for the basic of basic internet and they have unlimited without the xfi advantage what the fuck am I paying for? oh that's right I'm paying because you guys want to fuck people out of money for a shity service and tack on fees and other car salesman bullshit! Instead of trying to rape people out of money they don't have, why not try to help Americans? This isn't communist Russia as much as you want it to be so solve the problem concast.

This sounds like an AD-PITCH  not an update on an issue problem?  Am I reading this wrong?

4988375958	2020-07-11T20:31:24	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	I've had a number of recent disruptions (roughly every other night).  While watching Netflix, some time between 9-10 PM my cable modem (Arris SBG10) resets/restarts and cannot connect to the network.  I have local wifi, but no internet connection.  No program guide, only access to the last cable channel I had watched before streaming.  This condition lasts more than an hour.  I don't wait to see how long.  By morning all service is back to normal.  As this sequence has repeated a number of nights, it doesn't feel like a problem isolated to my service address.  Is this a central network problem?  If so, is there something I can do to re-establish service (other than waiting until morning)?

Current problems and outages	1 month - 200 modem / WiFi router re starts - 100 plus times spoke to customers support - 2 technicians showed up within a week’s span . Last one left saying network issue in area but my next door neighbor connected to same box having Comcast outside my home have no internet issues. So outage Excuse is a joke. Old mother need device to be connected and complete in a soup situation. Finally one good soul from support filed a high priority ticket.  Worst part is without phone data cannot even chat with support And once you refresh the page then new agent comes and have to explain same story again. Absolute nightmare mare and waiting for some magic to happen after paying for 1 gig service.

Please advise on what is going on with Xfinity services in Southaven,  MS.  This has become a pattern of no service for hours out of a day.  This is affecting our work at home, our security, and endless possibilities of Xfinity receiving legal ramifications.  Everyday and Everynight we have been without service. If someone did need to call from medical help, they have no phone service to do so.  If someone is trying to perform work in which they are compensated, they cannot because they have no internet service.  Furthermore, your home alarm and cameras don't work because you have no internet.   This is ridiculous and requires an explanation and compensation for lost time.  My service seems to be off more then its working and these are just a few dates that come to mind.  Then when you report your outtage, you are unable to speak with a real person.  And their system will ask you if you would like a notice once your service is corrected, via text or email.  They either never notify you or as soon as you hang up they send something saying your service is back up.  And it's not.  Xfinity your services is BAD right now and you need to fix it.  Or risk losing customers to C-Spire.  Thats the bottom line.

Purchased my own router because they kept telling me I went over my data amount for the monthand guess what happened with the new router... never went over my data limit infact it was considerably lower than what they told me so they steal your money that way. Now in the last week internet has been down for a over 24 hours on day and off and on all the rest. They need to figure out what the problem is, and give people  credits on their bills for the inconvenience of not having internet. Everything I have runs on the internet so the only thing i can use is my iphone and my data. Really Xfinity........get your act together
5016449391	2020-08-03T15:50:39	unavailable	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Freaking Comcast is down again, on a Monday in the middle of the work day in the middle of a pandemic while everybody is working from home. I had cox for 10 years, never, even once, did I have ANY issues. I have had Comcast for 5 years now and there is not a single day that I don’t lose my nerves because of their crappy coverage. (unfortunately due to my HOA forcing me, I had to switch to Comcast from Cox after I moved). I’ve had my modem switched multiple times, I have coverage extenders, I have done just about everything. Freaking Comcast has made my life miserable. I’m so done with it, but unless I sell my house and move, I can’t get rid of this horrible provider. I pay over $100 every month and there is not a single day that this freaking provider’s service isn’t down.

So instead of for an entire month you pay 225 youre now paying 225 for three weeks and they give you ten dollars. This doesnt even consider  the company having the assets to actually help their clientele instead of again, ten dollars. This doesnt even consider the fact that covid 19 has left a plethora of people working from home, who now, need to take time off work, which then leads to them making less money to use to pay for their bill, but hey at least they gave us ten bucks yanno?

Current problems and outages	Like others have said, giving your customers fake restoration times and days is much worse than simply saying that you don’t know when service will be restored. I’m in Montclair and lost internet 8/4 at around noon. It’s now 8/5 at 7:20pm and the restoration time has been changed SEVEN times. I had a chance yesterday to go elsewhere to work. I didn’t go because the restoration was predicted to happen within 4 hours. By constantly providing false info, you make planning HARDER. Given that it’s been over 30 hours, there’s no way that the initial 4 hour estimate was remotely possible at the time it was given. I know that it’s unlikely that anyone at Comcast reads these messages, and even less likely that they’d care. It’s not the outage that’s ultimately driven me to switch providers (once my service is restored), it’s the misinformation, which adds insult to injury.

The outage stated well after the storm and it has almost been two full days.  In the current world we rely on our internet for work more than ever before.   What is the issue?   Why is it taking this long to fix?   Power had been restored, but we can’t get internet or TV back?

In a total PR boiler plate response that they apologize, and they expect return of service to be Tuesday 8/11 by 3:00am. I find it a bit fishy that's when JCP&L is going to have service restoration for the broader Lebanon area. So I guess they are too cheap to have generators backbone their system. I so look forward to Elon Musk putting Comcast out of business with Starlink.

Current problems and outages	Net went down with dangerous thunderstorm about 12 hours ago here in Lady Lake, Florida, and still hasn't come back on. They keep pushing the time for return of service further and further, it went out day before yesterday for the same reason. It also goes down almost nightly for about 3 or so hours between 12am and about 5am, give or take . For such an expensive service that has a monopoly on our entire neighborhood, I'm pretty disgusted. Been stuck with this overpriced unreliable slow service for years now and am ready for some good old fashioned Capitalism to do what it is MEANT to do (but never does because no one regulates these corporations) and bring in some competition like it's supposed to to keep these people from charging outrageously for such a poorly maintained product. And as my kids' return to school looms and they go full virtual the pressure will be on for Xfinity to show they use all that obscene amount of monthly money we pay them to give us the best service they can or things are going to get nasty with A LOT of parents, teachers, and hell the state itself, my friends. School is required by law, people. Get your shit straight, Xfinity, it's about to be on. And it better stay on.

It cuts out randomly throughout the day MULTIPLE times, and whenever you call the customer service or support team, they simply try to “reset” your modem with a refresh signal from their own computers. FUN FACT: WE CAN ALREADY DO THAT OURSELVES THROUGH THE XFINITY APP!!! They can never seem to give you an explanation of what’s really going on with their internet service, and quite frankly, I’ve gotten fed up with this mess. Working from home with an unreliable internet connection is killing any chances of me signing with Xfinity ever again.

After countless calls and repeated troubleshooting and resets I was scheduled for a service tech to come to my house yesterday between 10am and 12pm. Around 2pm I called and was PROMISED the tech would be here by 5pm. No tech, no call, no reschedule. Today another hour or 2 on the phone and I still don't know if or when a tech is coming. We redid all the same ts on phone. Still no tv. Terrible customer service. And this is not even considering the fact that I cannot access voice mail on my mobile phone and they don't know how to fix that either. If ATT was not my only other choice for internet, I would no longer be a customer of Xfinity (the lesser of 2 evils).

I received the equipment from comcast and hooked everything up just fine but the TV screen kept giving me the same error over and over again "RDK-03036". no matter what I tried "RDK-03036" kept coming up. I called the Xfinity help line and they said it was an activation issue so they spent the next hour and a half trying to activate the cable box but of course it didn't work. Eventually the women in SINGAPORE, yes she told me she was in Singapore, said it was my splitter and that they needed to send out a technician to fix the problem and it would cost me $80.00 for the visit.  REALLY!!! $80.00 dollars for what, a SPLITTER.  I called a different cable company, hooked everything up and in 2 hours no more issues.  If any of you have a different cable company in your area, get rid of comcast and change over.  they wont get better until it hits there profits.    Bless you all and good luck.

5091650913	2020-09-30T17:00:24	vrspock	istheservicedown	Comcast outage or service down? Current problems and outages	Actually there ARE laws that do just that.  We have miles and miles of cable internet in our area the was subleased by Comcast to a now non-existent hole in the wall competitor that is now bankrupt.  Guess what?  No one can light up that cable and provide better services to the areas those cables exist because of dumbass regulations.  I know a local company that even offered to run fiber for a local ISP in our area to get them to expand their fiber coverage.  It was a no go because of regulations.  I dropped about $1300 to get fiber build out to my office in the middle of town because we required 100/100 synchronous connection minimum for what we do.  That was through a local ISP that has awesome service.  That's capitalism at work.  Sometimes they will do it and sometimes they can't because of stupid regulations.  Sometimes you can offer them $1 million cold hard cash and they can't do it because of regulations.  So how, exactly, is capitalism failing?   Monopolies are illegal under our capitalistic laws, but yet Charter and Comcast cannot co-exist in the same coverage area around here.  I don't get it.  I have lived in areas before where I had three different cable companies, two local telephone companies and two or three other options.  Back in the day I just dropped thousands of dollars into getting a T1 1.5Mbps dedicated loop from one of the backbone carriers to my home and office when everyone else had 56Kbps dialup connections.  Now it's a royal pain in the ass to get what you want where you want it no matter how much money you throw at it.  We have had to get politicians involved in putting pressure on the right spots in order to get crap done.  That's certainly not because of capitalism.  We have had to launch slander campaigns against certain ISPs with absolute pure abandonment to get crap done.  Why is that?  Not capitalism.  Dumbass regulations.  Of course, businesses thinking that they can just send everyone home to work when their home internet is on a non-dedicated shared node vs either a dedicated node or an SD-WAN configuration for the business is not very smart either.  There's a reason why business infrastructure costs more than non-business infrastructure.

Current problems and outages	Internet down, outskirts of Portland, Received notification when I checked Xfi. App, that Comcast shut service off at midnight to do maintenance and will turn it back on sometime around 6 a.m. wth..  This is becoming a serious issue as Comcast is doing this with regular frequency now, and without any sort of prior notice..  So tired of Comcast shutting internet down overnight, like those of us who work and/or   are active at night simply don't matter.

I rely on the xfinity email applications to manage spam directly on the source server -- although I use other email clients for search and some other functions that they do better than xfinity.  I have not been able to access any services on the xfinity servers.

Current problems and outages	As someone who gets an outage every slightest whisper of rain, my tip for getting your bill credited is, unfortunately, to keep calling and find an agent that's helpful. For some reason, some flat out refuse and claim they can't help you, and others can do it in seconds. Now, that means calling comcast is pretty much a hobby for me at this point, but maybe just try calling again if you haven't already done it twice?

Current problems and outages	Been without internet since Thursday despite the fact that my power was never actually out. Called out of work on Thursday and have had to make the 45 minute drive up 85 on Friday, Saturday, and now Monday to work in the office during a pandemic.   The Xfinity app shows there’s “no issues directed” at my address but when you look on the actual map it says there’s an outage in my zip code (30340) literally right on the Main Street that my apartment complex is adjacent to effecting 2500+ people. I’ve seen hundreds of tweets and FB posts from people either in my zip code or in the neighboring towns all stating they’re expediting outages so clearly it’s not just me despite customer service reps trying to claim it’s an issue with my equipment. However since I own my own modem/router instead of paying them every month it’s going to be a $70 charge for a tech to come out but they can’t even make it out for 3-5 days.    I’m pissed.
