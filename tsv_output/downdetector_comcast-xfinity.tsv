4950557652	2020-06-11T20:31:59	disqus_pkxjvKFMBf	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	It's always failing in my area. I live in a rural area, pay $100/month only to loose internet at least twice a day. Then they want to charge you for a tech, but I am paying for a service that's not reliable and they want to charge me for the tech because they outsource the work. It's a whole lotta BS! I live in Bedford Indiana.

We have been on the phones with you lot almost every damned day for these outages and every single time a new excuse is used to cover yourself from these problems your company is facing. Between 7a.m and 6p.m the internet here in Reading PA, REGULARLY disconnects for upwards of 3 hours and only goes back online for around 15 minute intervals! THIS IS GETTING SERIOUSLY OLD VERY QUICKLY WITH HOW EXPENSIVE YOUR PACKAGES ARE.  Not only this but we found out in this recent paynent that you INCREASED the package cost without warning! Seriously don't see the worth when it's not even stable!!

Comcast needs to learn to take care of the people that take care of them. I‚Äôll be turning every one I can off from Comcast‚Äôs services for as long as I live. I‚Äôve lived with their shitty services for a whole decade but this is the last straw: A whole week without a single minute of stable connection. Don‚Äôt send a tech unless you want them to get hurt.

4952254785	2020-06-13T03:02:23	disqus_0hyRC1IZQk	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	I live in Greenwood Indiana.  I pay over $100 for gigabit, and this past 2 months I have either been down or my download speed is around 80 Mb/s.  THAT'S NOT GIGABIT!  Not to mention, I have used my phone as a hotspot more than I have used comcast during working hours (I currently work from home) because Comcrap is too unreliable!  My only other option is going back to AT&T, very slow and very expensive!  But they were at least reliable!  I may report them to FCC again.  That seemed to work very well last time.
4952258973	2020-06-13T03:08:31	disqus_0hyRC1IZQk	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	I would suggest everyone start reporting this stuff to the FCC!  Comcast is legally obligated to address the issues at that point.  And the corporate office is required to contact you to resolve the issue.  If we start flooding the FCC with complaints, Comcast would freak out.  they would have no choice.

They say there's a lot of usage, at this point I don't care.  I pay $150/ month so everyone using the internet that they pay for sounds like something they need to fix.

4955256888	2020-06-15T18:15:50	myname_iss	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	I used to love Comcast/Xfinity and could not understand how so many people hated them. I had nothing but positive experiences with them - and the internet was fantastic. About 6 years ago I moved, and the internet in that house was nothing but terrible - and they blamed the walls. I dealt with it until this past winter when we finally moved, and couldn't wait to have great internet again.   The technician that came was, and I say this with the utmost respect, an old, lazy, out of shape man who clearly didn't do his job to the best of his abilities. We have a large house and a very large property, and this man chose to set up the router in the very front corner of the house, and we do not even get Wi-Fi on the other end of the house - forget upstairs or downstairs. We were promised internet and tv in our pool house - and then the tech told us that he couldn't set up service in another structure - even though customer service promised us that this wouldn't be an issue. If we want another tech to come out, we have to pay a nice hefty fee for their 'service'.  On top of this, the internet has never been so spotty in the entire decade + that I've had Comcast/Xfinity. Hardwire lines lose connection randomly and the speeds are almost never more than 50% of what we're paying for. Forget trying to use it between 4-11pm. It's abysmal. I finally understand the hate.

So that constitutional rights and civil liberties could be COMPLETELY violated and justify the "War on Terror" so the public would never question the real motive behind it. We as a species have turned against each other  ( I'm using Americans just as an example here because I was born and raised in the US) but this sort of thing happens all over the world. It has been documented, recorded and proven, and the outcome is always going the same. Color, race, religion, sexual preference, none of that matters now. We have all heard the saying,  "the definition of insanity, doing the same thing expecting different results"  well sadly, as much as we try to ignore it, it's absolutely true and continuing to ignore it will only lead us to the complete and total erradication of our species PERIOD. It doesn't take a Harvard degree, a spelling bee champion, or an understanding of quantum physics to see where we are headed. This is NOT a warning or a possibility, but a signed sealed 100% money back guarantee FACT and unless somehow, be it by some cosmic, religious, scientific, miracle we can put absurd,  meaningless, pointless, useless, things aside, like the arguing over frustrations with internet connectivity and who's smarter than who, and what corporate giant sucks and which one rocks...

The true problem is the human race. And perhaps you and I, and a small percentage of the species will ever come to that realization. Sadly we  will never have the capability to stop the momentum it has gained to this point and our miniscule meaningless blip of an existence in the grand scale of space  and time makes absolutely no difference whatsoever. We have long past the point of no return where we maybe, just maybe, could have been something other than a selfish, weaponized, dimensionally challenged species.

Towards the end of the chat, I asked them why they are having me do all these speed tests if all the results are the same on every device. He then asked me to try resetting my browser settings. I asked him why he was playing games and he reset my modem, when the chat came back I informed him it not cool to reset the modem with out a warning, and he reset it again and again till the chat timed out.  If there was an issue all over the place he could of just said that. I didn't google comcast outage until after. I just figured it was a local issue as it happens from time to time. Such a rude employee comcast. The name is probably fake, but John Mervin is the chat agent. I just don't get it.

Look up dns free or you can get a private one. Type in the address and click save  and bam your done  Google and and cloudflare dns are trash  there are many options open dns  also if you are using windows machine you have to go into the wifi adapter settings and click properties and configure the same dns after that go to command prompt under adminstater  do a dns flush. And clear cache and cookies out of your browser   And you will be good to go. If you never done it before look it up on youtube there are videos im sure of it showing you how

Was down almost all day yesterday. Came on about 9PM last night, went down again at about 7AM this morning. Funny how it's on when I'm least likely to use it. Now I just feel like they're screwing with me.   According to them, it's my (fairly new) modem, or my cables are loose. Perhaps if I shove said modem up their collective @ss, they'll finally be able to understand the issues are not on my end. Not paying $80/mo for no internet. Goodbye Comcast.

I can connect to my modem but every device in my home says the modem had no service.   Was on the phone with Comcast for over an hour yesterday. The customer support person actually called me back on a new number because he was afraid of getting in trouble for being on the phone too long. How absurd.  He honestly seemed to be doing his best but was unable to solve may issue. Got a call from another person in tech support who I assume was the first persons manager. Said person was unable to fix my issue and never called me back when they said they would.  So here  I am after a couple hours of my life wasted with nothing fixed. I work from home and can't get my work done. Very frustrating.

This is the 4th or 5th iteration of this experience during the shelter in place orders.  Poor customer service model with offshore agents and robo agents.  What fascinates me is that the cable and internet runs across the same fiberoptic line, but the cable is up and internet is down.  We are stuck at home - working from home, having to use our hotspots on cellular service instead service we pay hundreds of dollars for with you.  To make matters worse you don't want to refund for the days your service is down.  To all you voters this is what complete deregulation gets you.  Companies & conglomerates treat you like this without any consequence.

Customer service states there are no outages, yet their outage map shows there is.   Comcast needs to improve their customer service, it should not take 11 tries and two + hours on hold to get a customer service rep on the phone, who can only read a script in broken English.  We pay far too much for service that over that last two days has been unreliable and now non-existant. My only option during the pandemic is to work remotely and Comcast is preventing me from doing that.   Bring your customer support back to the USA, and improve your service.  If this continues I will change providers.

On a post on this site from a user of a banking system claimed that a large amount of money was taken from there account.

Come on Xfinity, you charge us big bucks only to cause us constant cable/internet issues.

I‚Äôm working from home due to obvious reasons and this is a constant interruption to my livelihood. I don‚Äôt even have access to several channels with my package that I pay $180 a month for; not to mention, the inconveniencing internet failures. Trying to get someone with a pulse on the phone for assistance rather than an irritating computer woman is nearly impossible. But, since this is a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù, I know they want more money, I finally tell the computer woman I‚Äôm a new customer. I GOT SOMEONE AFTER 9 FAILED ATTEMPTS. She was cool, she transferred me to technical support where I spoke to someone else pretty cool. I like your customer support reps, not your service. Be better for your customers because most of us feel this way.

4979746179	2020-07-04T22:47:46	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Well, go ahead and contact a lawyer. The terms of agreement you agreed to when you activated service states that there could be service disruption and also in the agreement it states you do will not hold Comcast and Xfinity liable for any reason.
4979754038	2020-07-04T22:58:00	HausOfThunderP	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	When you activated services, you signed a statement saying you will not hold Comcast/Xfinity liable for any reason. It also states that they can suspend/terminate service to you at anytime for any reason without notice. I understand how frustrating it is and I have said I would contact an attorney and when I actually contacted the FCC and Attorney General, they gave me a copy of the agreement that says I can‚Äôt. So, when people threaten a lawyer I laugh even at myself because I tried to do the same.

4980965081	2020-07-06T01:26:55	LordHermanMunster	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Depends on the circumstances first and foremost. Usually they elect to give a notice prior to disrupting someone‚Äôs services, before electing to disconnect them. Therefore they cover all basis of claims if someone is to file a complaint against them.  As for complaints through FCC, Attorney General and an attorney in general, even though you can go through sporadic outages from time to time, there is an extent as to where the provider breaches their own agreement, if the infrastructure continuously is failing on what the consumer is paying for. Usually your provider is suppose to provide bill credits in a pro-rated form for the time without services for a service outage. That is also in their contract and T&C‚Äôs page. Keep in mind, these days you usually have to argue with the provider for the bill credit, because they usually try to sneak out of giving those credits for service outages in general.  Usually the FCC is a good start for anyone with a valid complaint against their provider, as long as there is supporting proof.  Honestly, I would change providers if that was an option, as to continued problems and dealing with problems constantly.

4992010038	2020-07-14T21:17:15	disqus_AHnIp2YXc1	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	my XFINITY Internet connection is currently getting disconnected several times an hour between 1 and 20 minutes. Often it works fine for hours and then it starts failing. I am not sure if this type of behavior can be triggered by some type of interference from neighbors or weather. Maybe an Xfinity pole/amplifier or even switch/node issues .. who knows. I think I checked pretty much everything I can on my side of the network.  The modem status show between 20 and 200 uncorrectables/channel & hour (corrected number is 20-40% of that) I need to restart modem several times a day. This recovers service for a while. The modem also resets automatically due to T3/T4 timeouts Scanning the system through XFinity Status center often shows no issues at all.  The Xfinity outage map shows no outages at my address (zip: 30066), however, it has been showing an exclamation mark in the ZIP code area indicating unplanned outages for 51 .. 500 subscribers ( this value fluctuated from zero to 2,000 throughout the pas four weeks).  modem: SB6183 (also tested with ASUS CM-16), Signal levels 7-10 dBm down, 40-45dBm up service: 100 Mbps (things where better with lower speed, I upgraded the service just around the time these issues started. Coincidence? That's also the time everyone was stuck at home with home office.  Actions taken: hours of tech support chat for over four weeks now restart modem usually works (through XFinity website and power cycling) modem reset to factory settings XFinity checked outside line; added MoCa filter replaced modem .. different brand, same issues added splitter to cool down signals .. issues even worse (more frequent) running test  software for detailed info about up/downtime (ping three sites, 5 sec increment, show error if response is > 250ms for more than 20 seconds - typical response time is < 10ms)

There are 5 minute to 10 minute spans when there is no internet, it‚Äôs just completely dead, or  one will have hours when the internet is buffering so one‚Äôs TV is flickering.   With the kids going back to distance learning in a few weeks, really wish they would work these issues out and fix whatever is broken. An aging over burdened system now has thousands of new users on a load that was barely holding up prior to Covid. Without Broadband and other alternative providers in the area, Comcast lacks competition and gets away with providing abysmal service.

High speed internet should not continually drop out for 5 to 10 minute clips, or segments of buffering that last for hours. It definitely should not take over 12 service calls, numerous phone and email conversations, and registering a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, to have issues addressed. That appears to be the formulaic of penance every Comcast customer has to go through, before the company will abate issues.

We've called them, and each time we were told what time the internet would come on, the time would get bumped forward, and we'd go the whole day without internet. We've hit day three, and now they dont even give us a time frame.  Comcast service is so inconsistent and doesnt help at all. You're automatically sent to a machine that tells you absolutely nothing, and they still expect a bill at the end of this month.

5020096847	2020-08-06T13:18:06	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Why can't Comcast/ Xfinity have a REAL estimated timeframe when services will be restored from the Outage in New Haven CT?????. Services have been out since Tuesday August 4th. Xfinity must have some timeframe they are looking at.  Are we talking about Days or weeks here?????  No accountability !!!! Only want to charge you huge amounts of money on your bill.
5020104517	2020-08-06T13:23:31	disqus_TdM8GUFDh8	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	If you sign into your Xfinity account, they are offering a credit for each day. The highest amount is a whopping $15 but I suggest we all do it because that $15 compounded by hundred's of thousand's of customers would be significant.

5021219198	2020-08-07T09:11:57	disqus_84gcFJBArz	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	I have accepted the reality that Comcast the big monopoly and the only cable provider in Lake Villa IL apparently is so crap that they have these issues daily, sometimes monthly at best scenario and they proudly blame you for your problems by saying it is a signal problem from you so you get a tech, a tech comes and tells me they find nothing wrong. They blame their crap modems, send me a new one, still issues. When will Comcast accept that their service is malfunctioning in Chicago and not working right and that they need to fix it? Maybe it is a neighborhood problem? Nope they do nothing about because they know they can keep milking me for the dollar since there is no one better. Welcome to capitalism everyone isn't it great? Been like this for 4 years and now since Covid-19 hits, they expect people to have issues when they work from home under this lack of service? I have enough evidence to sue them and probably get my bill free forever after all the bs lies they made up with my contracts and stuff already, but all the legal fees make it not worth it. Their techs cannot read simple English and they are braindead and clueless about your services as well as you are and they come up with stupid fixes like resetting the modem because they do not understand that the issue with my service is that my modem keeps rebooting itself and they automatically assume wifi because their techs are super stupid. They use a poorly written script and they do not ever credit you after outages, you have to call and ask for it manually too even though the website likes you to think that you can get the credit automatically too. Guess they always like giving me 10$ every day for my trouble. Hey if they wanna keep making my bill free then let them because I'm not paying for it and they are so willing to just give you credit instead of fixing your issues if you complain enough. I love getting discounts on my services since I refuse to pay full price for it and in Chicago, they are legally allowed to not charge you for the day if you have issues, so every day you have issues just spam the online chat and get that discount baby! Maybe they will actually fix it now. Nope they know that I get credit from them because I even admitted that to them and apparently the big monopoly man hates money I guess because even after knowing that I am using their poor service to get major bill discounts, they still do not give a damn.

5038599564	2020-08-20T20:21:59	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Their service is abysmal, but they are actually rather good about compensation. Call in or chat the issue to them. Keep impeccable records of your correspondence stating when you reported the issue, what time you placed the call, and how the company responded, and who you spoke to and what was promised, as you will need to quote your notes to lodge an effective complaint. If it is not getting fixed submit a Better Business Bureau complaint based on your detailed records. It generally takes them 11- 12 service call to fix things. It is cheaper for them to send out a tech 11-12 times at a $12.99 an hour, to say, ‚ÄúI tightened this or that‚Äù than replace more expensive items that are malfunctioning, so they will run you around with that, until you hit that point In the complaint and exchange process and make the official BBB complaint. The longer they go w/o fixing your issue, you are paying them for the service,  yet they don‚Äôt have to replace something that is going to be a more costly fix, like restringing a wire or fixing something at their feeder station. That‚Äôs generally the dance we have to do with them, to get them to fix anything. The pattern is so eerily similar that I know it by heart at this point. 9 direct tech visits and about 3 pole crew visits, and hours and hours of calls and chats and escalations of the complaint and it will be fixed. Sometimes the process will take about 7 months for them to fix. You also can cut in at least one appointment that they don‚Äôt show up for (always a Saturday or Sunday appointment.) So about 13 appointments all together.  If you say, ‚ÄúI want to be reimbursed for this many days of lost service.‚Äù they will do so without argument, but it is always, ‚ÄúWe will deduct it from your next bill.‚Äù so they can hold on to your money longer and are receiving interest on it. Country wide, all those little bits of interest add up to financial profit for them. They generally will not reimburse you for a few hours of missed service, but I have never asked. Ours is out for an hour or two per day nearly ever day. It‚Äôs just standard for their presence in our city due to non competition with other providers. AlI I do is report it over here. The BBB will sometimes not publish your complaint on their website, as their policy is only publish the first 125 Comcast complaints per day in an area,  but it will still be processed by the BBB and a Comcast rep who knows what they are doing will deal with it, as you are up the food chain at that point.

It's been fully out since last night.  I tried their texting service, so at least I'd be notified when it was over, but that replied with a "no outage" response.  Reached a rep with their callback service, and she said the "outage" was in her system.  So frustrating when they don't use their own technology.  There's an outage.  So say there is and put that in the system, instead of making people wonder if there's something wrong with their setup.
5040088621	2020-08-21T22:27:46	disqus_fDpbjIku4b	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Same in and out service problems with our internet service here in Manitowoc WI, and its been going on for over two weeks now again. This also happened for about two weeks in June. At that time I went out and purchased a new router since the one I had appeared to be working fine but was already 4 years old, so I thought maybe it was my router, yet problem still existed for several weeks to follow, so I knew it was not the router, and every time I ran one of Comcast's worthless troubleshooting tests even after replacing he router, the results came back with 'No Problem Found', even though my service was going in and out every morning around 10:00 AM.     So when it started happening again this time, I went out and purchased a brand new modem, Again the modem appeared to be working fine but it was going on 3 years old, so I thought it was time for a new one and figured since Comcast troubleshooting kept coming back as 'No Problem Found', it was bound to fix the problem. I also replaced all of the fittings from the ped to the lockbox and behind the modem last week, yet the problem still exists every morning this week. Again every time I run one of Comcast's useless troubleshooting tests, Again it always comes back as 'No Problem Found',  even thought the internet service goes in an out every morning somewhere between 10:00AM and noon.    Total amount of money wasted trying to fix their issues, $200. Total accomplishment, it still goes out every day between 10:00AM and noon,yet when I run their useless troubleshooting tests, it still comes back as 'No Outages In Your Area' and 'No Problem Found'?     Not trying to tell them how to do their jobs at Comcast, but maybe they need to go out and check for condensation that's getting in either their taps, amps or the nodes, because the problem is definitely coming from their end, and it's not coincidental that it always happens in the morning when the temperature changes from cool over night to the hot sun beating on their equipment the next morning.

Since its affecting one of the major Internet backbone connections it doesn't really matter what your ISP is.

Pinging my neighbor's gateway is about 5ms, pinging my VPS is about 1,300, pinging google is 1,000... NOT an issue with my network at all.  Speed test using iperf between my neighbor and I is fine, speed test between my VPS and I is 0.25mb/s down and 14mb/s up.   Clearly this is an issue with XF and not my connection to their network.

Thank goodness he was here and told them it's definitely NOT working because I've been telling them that for days now.  He said someone would be calling me today (September 4th) to set up an appointment for someone else to come out.

We are the last place of refuge of freedom in the world. The corporate "bankster" whores have systematically worked to destroy this country over the last 3 decades at least. Did you know these same bankers who created our Federal Reserve and the IMF and the World Bank have promised China the 21st Century?  A country that didn't have running water 60 years ago, now has the global elite working with them to destroy the last bastion of a free humanity. A New World Order has been designed and in order for it to work, in the eyes of the elite, America must be destroyed.  Trump knows all of this and is stopping this. Well he is trying like hell, if we only had an honest free press in this country then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation. Since We the People, do out number the paid puppets in DC.  But the owners of the major media outlets are all members of the CFR and Tri-latteral commission. Many of the elite participate at Davos as well and they broadcast last year the destruction of the US and called the program "The Great Reset" Trump means it when he says America First. Many in this country see the big picture and the sleeping giant is wide awake. The Big Steal through vote manipulation is a real concern with this whole "mail-in" voting idea. All I want is a fair vote and the corrupt establishment is working Overtime to make that sure that doesn't happen. Peace

Golly, can you imagine? If Xfinity spent as much money on actually fixing their system as they do on ads and CEO bonuses, we might have 9600 bps speeds, and fuzzy 480p TV...

I am watching a show and the CC shows "We live with AT&T and we are well past the honeymoon phase." Now comes the problem - Remote control won't work. Can't change channels or disable CC, can't turn the set off. Did AT&T hack their system? I will wait it out and see what happens. I like reruns of NCIS anyway. Anybody else have this problem?

5085531270	2020-09-26T00:42:27	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	The problem with cox Comcast and all these other isp. They have crap routers !  You are going to pay what 10 to 20 a month for there equipment. Just buy your own router and tell them you don‚Äôt want know public hotspot on you can shut it off on your account or you can let people use it  it‚Äôs up to you for what you pay a year you can have a pretty good router that can handle. TVs tablets phones or whatever it is you. Have connected. There routers can handle at the max maybe 5 devices then they start slowing down. Try a night hawk  it has several channels and streams for a lot of devices to be connected with up to 1000 gigs speed or more some have like 1500 just depends how much you want to spend. Trust me it will help and your cable and bet bill will be reduced 10 or 20 dollars

5091135836	2020-09-30T08:48:31	andrewsherrod	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	I was used to the periodic random 3 AM/4 AM outages, I always guessed they were maintenance windows gone wrong. But since I switched to the new white router with only 3 lights (orange, green and white) it seems to be flickering out a lot more, and the reconnect is even slower than the old multiple light modem I had. (Annapolis MD) Not sure if it is a network issue, a lousy new modem design, incompatibility or what, but we already replaced the new and improved modem once, had a tech out, reset, and the thing still flickers at random. Ok, had rain today so maybe a line is down, but after all the other outages, a bit wary of it.

I anticipate a few bumps along the way ... but it can't be worse than Comcast has been since Covid. I placed my order today! I've been on Comcast business class since 2014 in Snohomish, and for about ten years prior in Sammamish. Their consistent under-investment in their network and just wanting to leach as much from their customers rather than rolling out continuous improvements to keep pace with technogy is abysmal. This pattern led them to having a network that's totally under-sized when everyone is home. I'll still keep Comcast around for a bit utilizing two ISPs for redundancy... but let's just say they aren't getting any incremental dollars at this point unless they can start delivering those 9's of reliability.

Again, CS tried to blame it on an internal problem and wanted to schedule a service call for 7 days later.  Oh, sure, were all working from home and not being able to access our office for a week wouldnt be a problem, right? Only after I raised enough hell and refused to accept the "troubleshooting/get them off the phone suggestions" do I get "escalated" to someone who, thankfully, acknowledged the firmware problem and managed to get my modem rolled back to the previous version.

5108480031	2020-10-13T12:46:26	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	(Salt Lake City) Comcast has been down at my house for close to 24 hours. At my work less than a mile away internet never went out. Maybe I should switch to business class. Due to a huge wind storm, internet only went down once this entire year at my work.
5108543461	2020-10-13T13:46:07	disqus_UJJQuOflFe	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	(West-Central MA) We had a storm last Wednesday which knocked out power and cable. Electricity was restored on Friday. Comcast hasn't restored its cable yet even though we are told by Comcast agents (first on Saturday, then Sunday, then Monday, and now Tuesday) that the work will be done by the end of the day. Further, the phone agents don't seem to hear that we need a crew and a cherry picker truck. The cable is draped across the driveway at one point, just high enough to drive under. At another point it runs across the driveway and we have to drive over it. We want to be told the truth -- it's possible that Comcast isn't going to repair anything until they clean up the jury-rigged arrangement which the power company left on the pole on the state road.

I was in a MS Teams meeting, and people all over the area lost internet and my daughter's school lost internet too.

Look, the Xfinity APs are still the fastest we have in the USA so that's a plus but that's entirely due to the monopoly Comcast has on the fiber optics buried strung up next to the power lines so that's HUGE minus imo. That would be your opinion to if you had ever heard about other countries isp's. Seriously. We're talking about super fast 'net, able to d/l full version ultra HD movies in minutes, and at times mere seconds. AND at a fraction of the costs that we pay.

5113173921	2020-10-16T22:07:49	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	If you use a wireless Comcast router, there's a very good chance that it's functioning as a public hotspot for any Comcast customer wandering by. It needn't be that way -- I've got instructions for killing the public hotspot while still keeping the router for your personal use.           Few people realize that their wireless Comcast modem/router combo does double-duty -- not only is it a home wireless network, but it also provides other Comcast customers hotspot-based Internet access when they pass by. If you've ever seen an Xfinity hotspot appear on one of your wireless devices, that hotspot is almost certainly tapping into someone's home Comcast router.           The Comcast routers have two different antennas, one for your home network, and one for an Xfinity public hotspot. So there's no evidence that it's a security hazard. However, it does mean that you'll be sharing your bandwidth with other Comcast customers.           It also means that you're footing Comcast's electricity bill. That second antenna for the public hotspot uses up electricity, and you're paying for it. The tech company Speedify claims that it costs each Comcast customer $23 per year in additional electric costs. And two San Francisco residents are suing Comcast over the dual use of the routers, claiming that Comcast is "exploiting them for profit" by using their home Comcast routers for the service. The suit charges that Comcast hasn't adequately told its customers about how the routers are being used, and alleges that "the data and information on a Comcast customer‚Äôs network is at greater risk" because of the way in which the router "allows strangers to connect to the Internet through the same wireless router used by Comcast customers."      LOOK IT UP FOR YOURSELF
5113178904	2020-10-16T22:11:04	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	If you're a Comcast customer, there's a quick and easy way to turn off hotspot access to the public. First log into your Comcast account at customer dotcomcastdot com. Then click Users & Preferences-->Service Address, which will have your address. Underneath your address click Manage Xfinity WiFi, and then click Disable Xfinity Wifi Home Hotspot. After that, click Save.           If you're feeling a little more adventurous, you can disable the router's wireless capabilities altogether, only use it as a cable modem, and yse your own router instead. For instructions,

5118192329	2020-10-20T21:29:49	disqus_qZyChCkOrm	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Johns Creek GA here, near Atlanta. Internet slows and drops intermittently throughout the day, every day. Working from home, including video conference calls, is exceptionally frustrating. Just spent a ton of time on the phone with 2 levels of tech support to have them continue to ask if the Internet is up, which it is at the moment, and declare everything fixed. They then prepare to hang up, thank me for calling, etc. Like they didn't hear me the 100 times I explained that it intermittently slows to a crawl and/or drops altogether, that I need stability. Finally ended the call because tech support is like a deer in headlights once they've run through their remote reset and tests. Ultimately, no help whatsoever, unstable service, poor value for the dollar and the tech "support" accomplishes zero. What am I paying for?

5129614468	2020-10-29T14:44:45	disqus_4VAIcV8PmV	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Comcast's bot literally hung up on me for no reason while I was trying to get in touch with a person.

I tried asking about billing (because I'll need a refund to cover what will be now a huge data spike on my cell phone for work), and the bot literally gave me no options to talk to a person and hung up on me again.  This is what happens when companies abuse their monopoly. We need a lot more regulations to be put on internet service providers, including legally declaring them utilities. If I cannot reach a person for a service that I pay over $700 a year for and that has an effective monopoly in my area, then there obviously needs to be a LOT more government oversight to keep them in check.  Looking at Trump's FTC appointee, who rolled back the designation of internet services as a utility service (and so rolled back a bunch of regulations on these companies, including allowing them to <i>collect your internet traffic data from all websites</i> so they could build data for better serving ads), it's obvious that the only party that gives a crap about these issues are Democrats. Looks like I'm voting blue on Tuesday all the way down the ticket. This will be my first time doing so in 8 years.
5129686309	2020-10-29T15:37:30	unavailable	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	my peplink router notified me at 12:21am that comcast was down. so i checked comcast website and it said routine maintenance should be back up at 6am. 6am rolls around and its still not working despite the website saying no problems reported. ive rebooted numerous times. comcast DHCP wont give my router an IP address. so I plug in my laptop and get the ip info. i then manually input this into my router as static and it works then disconnects. something wrong at comcast.

5131041510	2020-10-30T15:28:27	disqus_4VAIcV8PmV	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Let's look at GDP growth from 2014-2019. When Trump took office, there was a 0.2%-0.3% increase in GDP growth relative to what Obama delivered. That's great! Except that growth was fueled by the GOP increasing the deficit for tax cuts* to get that boost, so that extra growth was debt-fueled: we took on $5 of <b>additional</b> debt for every $1 of <b>additional</b> GDP growth. That is, if you account for extra debt spending, the economy actually got worse since Trump took office, even before COVID. And then during COVID, we can't get the economy back to normal because many people don't want to die under Trump's "leadership" that has offered no plan to actually deal with COVID and make the country safe again.  I find it remarkable when people listen to Trump but don't actually look at how his policies play out. This is part of a pattern: voters don't consider how the deficits <b>consistently</b> go up under Republican presidents due to tax cuts they make without cutting spending and consider how that debt more than offsets the economic gains from such tax cuts.  *The lion's share of tax cuts by the GOP also go to the ultra rich.

Customer service is useless, all they tell you is that there is an outage in your area and that it will be fixed soon.  It has said this for 3 days. This is bull crap. How is it, in this day and age, that it can take Comcast (the largest internet and cable provider in the US) more than 3 days to fix this outage problem? I mean come on. It can't take this long. And then to not communicate ANYTHING with their customers about how long they estimate this outage to last or to even tell them what the problem is (is it lines down, server issues, just a high level summary)  well it's just ridiculous. MAKE SURE YOU CALL THEM TO GET YOUR OUTAGE REFUND.

I've tried contacting Xfinity customer service to no avail. The only information Comcast provides is that an outage has been detected and will be fixed soon. I work from home and without wifi I can't work. The least you can do is tell your customers what is going on. How can it take this long to fix an outage caused by a storm?  I'm pretty sure this isn't the first Comcast outage caused by a storm. In a time where more people than ever rely on internet for work and school shouldn't you have everyone you can working as hard as they can to get this problem fixed. My friend had her att uverse service go out and att had it fixed in less than 12hours. So what's the hold up @comcastcares?

Obviously, something and they are having problems in Baltimore and not doing a thing to repair the issue. Comcast is a deplorable company and offers nothing but substandard service in my community. They can invest money into underground wiring in  a white city like Boston with even older infrastructure, yet in a majority minority community like Baltimore they won‚Äôt do what they have to do to correct these issues and take the wiring and put it underground so it won‚Äôt be going out every day. It‚Äôs modern day redlining. If they truly feel Black Lives Matter as they say they Do on their twitter and Facebook they would infest some  of the billions in profit they have made in a city that has a substantial digital divide.

I highly doubt my year old SB8200 is dead. It connects and syncs up, even switches to indicating the DOCSIS 3.1 link on the downlink, but little data flows. They claimed they were sending someone out to check the line by today (squirrels chewing the lines are a common issue here), but I have yet to see evidence anyone touched the line.

Wanted to rip my hair out the past few says that went it went  from bad to abysmal. It's fine during the school day, but before school, lunch hour, directly after school and the evenings and weekends are like having no internet.. If they can get it to work during the school and work day, why can't they get it to work the rest of the time. They say they don't bundle, but they have to be. It is the worst service of any internet provider we have had. Everything you click on takes several minutes to load. So even simply tasks turn into 15 -20 minute time sinks. I dearly wish we could go with another company. Pay for high speed internet and get slower service than dial up in the 90's.

Get the SB8200 and a Netgear R7000, and flash the router with dd-wrt.  Don't use the Comcast DNS settings (which are hardcoded into Comcast routers) use google DNS or cloudflare DNS. 'Maintenance' usually means sending someone to the basement with a reboot floppy to restart the DNS servers.

Since crapfinity doesn't want to invest in bettering their infrastructure aka get the better fiber wire that's been available for years, buckle up cause just another COVID side effect. Tip to get credit toward bill: go to xfinity site troubleshoot and check for outages and scroll down to where you'll see "Experienced a recent outage?" You may be eligible for q credit. If you click check to see if eligible, sometimes you can get a $15 credit off your bill. I hit the limit for it already apparently cause I already got $30 off for this months outages so far.

Its understandable that this service needs to have its technical and maintenance procedures. Yet it would be great to let the customer know in advance when a outage is planned unless its a emergency situation, and in order for the customer to plan on doing other things while the outrage happens.
5158619379	2020-11-20T05:43:01	disqus_2z8XAyFTTK	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Many outages over the past few weeks. One planned, but only with notice at 11pm the night before. The last of which went beyond three days. After they pushed a message that the issue had been resolved today, there is zero change. I‚Äôm getting literally 2.9% of the download speed I am paying for. Calls to support are a predictable shell game. They always ask you to do all the troubleshooting you have already done, then they try to pawn it off on the cable in your home in, or your modem, or your router. Or they will run a new line for the pole that does nothing - I literally have four runs for the pole because they don‚Äôt remove the old lines. They just add another.   Last time This happened, I actually had a new modem ready and a cable that came straight from the pole line to my modem to illustrate that it was on their end. That was after three service techs came out. They finally listened. Although I had to tell them how to fix it, which I had learned from yet another previous issue that ran that same course. And of course, I had to fight about service call charges, when it was their issue all along. It‚Äôs not my fault the first two guys they sent seemed less aware that I was about the issue and how to remedy.   Honestly if by design, I were tasked with disenfranchising customers, I could not do as thorough a job as Comcast has in championing mediocrity. ATT may be no walk in the park, but I have to say, it‚Äôs not going to be hard to beat Comcast. Comcast makes moving on an easy choice.

You could you set your watch by the internet rush hour that occurs at lunch hour and after school till the wee hours. We are getting constant internet buffering in my area. It‚Äôs a wonderful thing that they are doing getting all the kids connected, but if everyone else‚Äôs work internet is now buffering continually and slow as molasses it‚Äôs a disservice to paying customers. The amount of buffering going on is constant. It takes forever for anything to load, forms are lost, and emails lost. Really getting to be highly problematic. This would not be an issue if they set those accounts to a different frequency.
5159479611	2020-11-20T20:57:56	disqus_ADfhPiG2Ya	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	It takes approximately 12 to 13 service calls for them to actually fix the issue. And they recommend all that extra stuff which never fixes the issue as it is a pole issue or their feeder station or wires. So a waiting game they engage you in. As long as they are receiving your payment, it is cheaper for them to send out a tech for $12 dollars an hour, To say that they tightened something that was loose rather than address the real issue at the pole of feeder station, or restring the faulty wires. So they deliberately stretch out those wait times and have you engage in all those tech visits on purpose to tire you out.

5159899145	2020-11-21T04:01:12	tp517	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	Me too! Internet went down here in San Lorenzo, Ca. on Tuesday morning during the rain. It was off until today when a tech showed up, verified it was down and didn't have the needed equipment to get on the pole to fix it. Before he left he said he was going to reschedule and call me to get another tech to come out with a bucket truck to get up to the pole. He never called back. A couple of hours after he left the internet magically came back on. VERY STRANGE from start to finish. WTF IS GOING ON?

For some reason, specific devices like my laptop and my PS4 will periodically get kicked of the network, while other devices will not. I can always reconnect the devices afterwards, I just think it's weird. I find it annoying, but it's not the end of the world.<s>But it's Comcast, so I'm not surprised.</s>

5160568769	2020-11-21T19:03:52	disqus_ADfhPiG2Ya	downdetector	US comcast-xfinity	It has happened so frequently that I have gotten it down to a science. It is always 12 -13 service calls on the issue before they fix things and escalating the complaint. It‚Äôs a pattern that never falters. The tech coming in two days will say the same exact thing as the previous tech, ‚ÄúThe ___ was loose I tightened it.‚Äù Tech 3 or 4 will tell you it is your ___ and you should purchase an extra this or that. After you have they will still say it is on your end. So you will go through a protracted dance with them and hours on the phone or chat line, 20 or so emails. Finally on visit 12 or 13 a pole crew will  eventually come out and actually fix the thing, which was always on their end. It almost follows a strict scrip. The techs will sometimes tell you, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs an issue further down the line, but they have to go along with Comcast‚Äôs internal ‚Äúwear your complaint down‚Äù strategy rather than fix issues immediately as that a month to seven months when they do not have to replace non working parts.
